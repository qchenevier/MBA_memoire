Throughout this report, we analyzed digitalization holistically by going through both the stimulus-reaction and actor-organization dimensions.

To put it more simply than in the [executive summary](#executive-summary): there is no doubt that there is a substantial and sustainable increase of information in speed, quantity, complexity and value, since several decades.

This increase of information is creating and intensifying networks which are changing the dynamics of organizations and their environment. Organizations cannot compete anymore if they keep an old structure, adapted to a world where the information is scarce, since the competitive forces are changed by the growing networks.

To become as efficient as the information-based networks, organizations must become networks themselves, built on a strong information management backbone. Many organizations need to reassess their assets to better exploit those relevant to the new environment. Finally, by becoming efficient networks, organizations have the opportunity to improve in all three value disciplines.  

In the end, organizations cannot become efficient networks if their actors are not behaving as if they belong to network. This require a change of the mindset of the actors of an organization: they must become better at information transmitting, processing and decision-making. The information era gives to organizations the ability to thrive, if the quality and the quantity of the decisions taken in the organization increases.

Finally, leadership skills need to change according to this new imperative, by being more focused on encouraging learning & information flowing than before. Today's leaders need to be more focused on coaching than on commanding.

If we look at the organizations which are the most thriving today, we might note that most of them have already discovered all those principles. However the information revolution hasn't reached its apogee yet as many new technology waves seem to be on the verge of deploying their influence in society: additive manufacturing, internet of things, blockchain, CRISPR-based genetic engineering, transport automation... All these technology waves are part of the information era and might let us think that this technological revolution might be longer and stronger than the other technological revolutions we have witnessed before.

Humanity is levelling up and it might gaining several levels at once.
