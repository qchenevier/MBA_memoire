High-level recommandations with the help of what question you need to answer to define your strategy:

- Buy or sell businesses in your portfolio ?
- Lead your customers or follow them ?
- Cooperate or compete with new attackers ?
- Diversify or double down on digital initiatives ?
- Keep digital businesses separate or integrate them with current nondigital ones ?
- Delegate or own the digital agenda ?

## McKinsey 7S framework [@McKinsey2008]

The 7S McKinsey framework, allowing to frame an analysis of an enterprise strategy:

- Shared values
- Systems
- Strategy
- Structure
- Skills
- Style
- Staff

## Exponential organizations [@VanGeest2014]

A singularity university book about new organizations with hyper-fast growth and their structuring principles:

- **IDEAS** (related to left brain: order, control & stability)
  - Interfaces
  - Dashboards
  - Experimentation
  - Autonomy
  - Social
- **SCALE** (related to right brain: creativity, growth & uncertainty)
  - Staff on demand

## The Future of Employment: How susceptible are jobs to computerization ? [@Frey2017]

Criteria:

- Routine vs Non-routine
- Cognitive vs Manual

Non-routine:

- legal writing
- truck driving
- medical diagnoses
- persuading...

High probability of digitization:

- Routine intensive occupations = well-defined procedures

Low probability of digitization:

- Services: because of higher degree of flexibility and physical adaptability
- Cognitive jobs

Low Probability of offshoring:

- specific work location needed
- face-to-facepersonal communication required

Beware: activity that can be offshored != activity that can be automated. E.g.: cashier not offshorable but replaced by self-service technology.

> The Idea that technological advances favor more skilled workers is a twentieth century phenomenon. [@Acemoglu2002]

3 Tasks categories which won't be automated:

- **Perception & Manipulation** tasks: in unstructured work environment (personal house vs airport or train station), irregular objects.
- **Creative Intelligence** tasks: it's making unfamiliar combinations fo familiar ideas and find which ones make sense. E.g: jokes. Value is creativity is inherently subjective, so evaluation of a robot on creative Intelligence tasks is not possible.
- **Social intelligence** tasks: involving negociation, persuasion and care.

Examples:

Category                    | Max              | Min
--------------------------- | ---------------- | ------------
Social intelligence         | Public relations | Dishwasher
Creativity                  | Fashion Designer | Count Clerk
Perception and manipulation | Surgeon          | Telemarketer
