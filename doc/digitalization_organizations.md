## The Future of Employment: How susceptible are jobs to computerization ? [@Frey2017]

##### Dimensions

Criteria:

- **Routine** vs **Non-routine**
- **Cognitive** vs **Manual**

3 Tasks categories which won't be automated:

- **Perception & Manipulation** tasks: in unstructured work environment (personal house vs airport or train station), irregular objects.
- **Creative Intelligence** tasks: it's making unfamiliar combinations for familiar ideas and find which ones make sense. E.g: jokes. Value is creativity is inherently subjective, so evaluation of a robot on creative Intelligence tasks is not possible.
- **Social intelligence** tasks: involving negotiation, persuasion and care.

Examples:

Category                    | Max              | Min
--------------------------- | ---------------- | ------------
Social intelligence         | Public relations | Dishwasher
Creativity                  | Fashion Designer | Count Clerk
Perception and manipulation | Surgeon          | Telemarketer


##### Quotes
Non-routine work examples:

- legal writing
- truck driving
- medical diagnoses
- persuading...
<!--  -->

Taxonomy of jobs:

- High probability of digitization:
  - Routine intensive occupations = well-defined procedures
- Low probability of digitization:
  - Services: because of higher degree of flexibility and physical adaptability
  - Cognitive jobs

Low Probability of off-shoring:

- specific work location needed
- face-to-face personal communication required

Beware: activity that can be off-shored != activity that can be automated. E.g.: cashier not off-shorable but replaced by self-service technology.

## Digital ubiquity: How connections, sensors, and data are revolutionizing business [@Iansiti2014]

##### Dimensions

GE's technical transformation:

- adding **digital sensors** to its machines,
- connecting them to a **common, cloud-based software platform**
- investing in **modern software development** capabilities
- building **advanced analytics** capabilities


GE's marketing & organizational transformations:

- **transactional**: break/fix. **Sell** parts & repair.
- **contractual**: service agreement. **Share risk**, reducing the total cost of ownership.
- **expanded customer outcomes**: optimized assets & operations. Use data & analytics to **provide decision support** services.


A business model is defined by two things:

- how the organization **creates** value for its customers
- how the organization **captures** that value

##### Quotes

Today, many companies are having new competitors, shifting the customer value proposition away from acquiring reliable industrial equipment to deriving new efficiencies and other benefits through advanced analytics and algorithms based on the data generated by that equipment.

GE has responded by:

- adding **digital sensors** to its machines,
- connecting them to a **common, cloud-based software platform**
- investing in **modern software development** capabilities
- building **advanced analytics** capabilities

Now, GE's revenue from its jet engines is tied not to a simple sales transaction but to performance improvements: less downtime and more miles flown.

Many software companies (and not only) have started to transform their business model:

- switching from product to service revenue
- experimenting with outcomes-based business models in cases where revenue might be tied to the efficiencies delivered by an enterprise application

The paradigm is **not displacement and replacement**, but **connectivity and recombination**

A business model is defined by two things:

- how the organization **creates** value for its customers
- how the organization **captures** that value

Digital transformation changes both:

GE creates values by extracting useful data from sensors, by optimizing equipment performance, utilization and maintenance. It captures that value by charging a percentage of the customer's incremental revenue from improved performance.

GE **sells less** hardware but has developed **mutually profitable partnerships**.

GE's transformations:

- **transactional**: break/fix. **Sell** parts & repair.
- **contractual**: service agreement. **Share risk**, reducing the total cost of ownership.
- **expanded customer outcomes**: optimized assets & operations. Use data & analytics to **provide decision support** services.


What to do:

- Building software capabilities
  - Problems encountered:
    - Process: GE has never been known for its agility. 80% the software products they edited were not profitable. "It was taking us **years to build the software and years to get it out the door**"
    - Developer Talent: Most of their developers had experience with outdated technologies. They were **reliant on outside vendors**, sometimes for full development.
  - Solutions deployed new GE Software HQ:
    - "**Co-location** is everything"
    - creation of a **common software platform**
    - **No enforcement of compliance**: "We are going to do this, you can be on the train or not".
    - No dedicated P&L for the software: **Different incentives** that don't create competition with the businesses.
- Learning to sell the new model

  _"We are trying to sell them something they don't know they need and they can't see when it works."_
  - Change the mindset of the marketing by switching:
    - from the "box seller" mentality: "**features list** with pricing and discount caps"
    - to a solution-based sales focused on pain points how to enhance **customer's operating performance**
    - It requires an approach that integrates with the client's proprietary **financial and operational data** and an extensive familiarity with the client's balance sheet, financial strategies and approach to the market.
    - "Our sales team has to do a whole range of new spreadsheet calculations and modeling before we even approach a potential customer."
- Building out the ecosystem

  _"Starting from the idea of asset optimization and no unplanned downtime... the maximum customer **value is in the ecosystem**. How **open** do we want this to be ?"_

  - To build its ecosystem: GE is experimenting with different types of partnerships, like joint-ventures. GE has also partnered with potential competitors (like Intel, Cisco, Accenture, Amazon web services)

- Approaching Digital Ubiquity

  - Apply the digital lens to existing products & services
  - Connect your existing assets across companies
  - Examine new modes of value creation
  - Consider new value-capture modes
  - Use software to extend the boundaries of what you do.

What makes digital technology transformational ?
Digital technology has **3 fundamental properties**:

- digital signals can be transmitted perfectly without error: **no depreciation with time/usage**
- digital signals can be replicated indefinitely: **no production cost**
- digital signals can be communicated to the incremental consumer at zero marginal cost: **no transport cost**


## Strategic principles for competing in the digital age [@Hirt2014]

##### Dimensions

Opportunities and threats:

- **Enhancing interactions** among customers, suppliers, stakeholders, and employees
- **Improving management decisions** as algorithms crunch big data from social technologies or the Internet of Things
- **Enabling new business or operating models**, such as peer-to-peer product innovation or customer service

7 forces at work:

1. New pressure on prices and margins
1. Competitors emerge from unexpected places
1. Winner-takes-all dynamics
1. Plug-and-play business models
1. Growing talent mismatches
1. Converging global supply and demand
1. Relentlessly evolving business models at higher velocity


Managing the strategic challenges: Six big decisions

- Decision 1: Buy or sell businesses in your portfolio?
- Decision 2: Lead your customers or follow them?
- Decision 3: Cooperate or compete with new attackers? (link with @Iansiti2014: GE's doing more partnerships)
- Decision 4: Diversify or double down on digital initiatives? (_potential_ link with @Woodard2013: Augment the design capital by augmenting the options or diminish the technical debt)
- Decision 5: Keep digital businesses separate or integrate them with current nondigital ones? (link with @Karimi2015: depending on the characteristics (size, existing assets, agility needed, risk aversion...), some have integrated or not the digital business unit)
- Decision 6: Delegate or own the digital agenda?
