Since the invention of the first mechanical computer by Charles Babbage in the early 19<sup>th</sup> century and the conceptualization of the modern computer by Alan Turing in 1936, information technologies have constantly revolutionized science, the economy and now society as a whole.

#### Digitalization is encompassing the whole society {-}

Since the 1990's, we live times of uncertainty [@Perez2004]. The world is digitizing so rapidly that most users are scrambling to adapt [@Manyika2015]. Basically, the present period is defined as one of transition between two distinct technological styles -or techno-economic paradigms- and at the same time as the period of construction of a new mode of growth. Such long waves of technological change affect the whole system, the entire structure of society, worldwide. Technological change is a complex social process involving technical, economic, social and institutional factors in a mesh of interactions [@Perez2004].

There are mechanisms inherent to the way technologies diffuse which result in technological revolutions or changes of paradigm every fifty or sixty years. This results in long term patterns of continuity and discontinuity in the techno-economic sphere which require matching transformations at the socio-institutional level. The general framework of socioeconomic regulation has a natural inertia. So, during paradigm transitions, there are very intense transformations in technology and the economy and a high level of inertia and confusion in the socio-institutional sphere. As a result, the social consequences of each transition are vast and profound, as is the human suffering [@Perez2004].

#### Digitalization is polarizing the world {-}

In each country, centrifugal trends generate unprecedented growth and wealth, at one end, and increasing poverty, deterioration and degradation, at the other [@Perez2004]. Digitization is happening unevenly, and users with advanced digital capabilities are capturing disproportionate benefits [@Manyika2015].

Those trends involve widespread unemployment; the obsolescence of qualifications at all levels, the geographic dislocation of people and activities; the growth of rapid wealth at one end and of growing poverty at the other [@Perez2004]. There will be more economic dislocation : the day-to-day nature of work will change, companies redefine many roles and job displacement rates could accelerate sharply over the next decade [@Manyika2015].

Also a new and more pervasive dynamic appears to be at work : the gap between the digital "haves" and "have-mores" is growing as the most advanced users pull away from everyone else [@Manyika2015].

#### Digitalization is a complex phenomenon impulsing change at all scales {-}

The literature about digitalization and the current technological revolution tries to summarize the main facts about the changes happening in the world and suggest strategies and decisions to take about it. However, each paper is tackling the problem from its own perspective, so it is not easy to understand the phenomenon globally. For example, @Perez2004 analyses each techno-economic paradigm through three inter-related levels: technology systems (microelectronics, software & telecommunications), "best practice" model (flexible organizational model), "common sense" principles for organizational & institutional design (decentralization, networking, continuous improvement, ...). Whereas other authors suggest different ways of analyzing digitalization.

Without a unifying intellectual framework, it seems uneasy to deal with everyday issues such as:

- Is the diffusion of smartphones driving decentralization in an organization?
- What kind of skill is useful to thrive in a job market where automation and machines seem to be nibbling every job? Should we favor emotional intelligence or computer programming?
- Is the email improving an organization's performance by accelerating communication or worsening it by fostering bureaucracy ?

#### An intellectual framework to understand digitalization {-}

This document aims at summarizing the various research on this topic for the last two decades by exploring 2 dimensions:

- **Impulsion vs Reaction:** What is changing vs what can you do about it? What influencing your behavior? What kind of behavior should be favored? What is the new context for organizations? How can they adapt to it?
- **Micro-economic scale vs macro-economic scale:** What is happening locally vs what is happening globally? What is happening from the point of view of a mere human? What are the technologies at hand? What are the new systems of technologies and humans?

To understand the whole digitalization phenomenon, we suggest to follow an intellectual journey which encompasses those 2 dimensions:

1. **Impulsion at micro-economic scale**

    What are the digital technologies and how they are used in our daily lives? What are our new behaviors?

2. **Impulsion at macro-economic scale**

    From these local drives, What are the new drivers and changes impacting the efficiency of the organizations? How are the systems of humans and machines behaving and changing the market dynamics?

3. **Reaction at macro-economic scale**

    From these drivers, how an organization should adapt? Where should it be headed by its leaders? What kind of strategy can be envisioned?

4. **Reaction at micro-economic scale**

    Having built the strategy, what kind of local action can be triggered to transform the organization? What kind of technologies should be used and how? For each individual, what kind of behavior should be encouraged?

Then, using this intellectual framework, we propose **a tool to support digital transformation efforts for organizations' leaders**.
