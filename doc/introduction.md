Since the invention of the first mechanical computer by Charles Babbage in the early 19<sup>th</sup> century and the conceptualization of the modern computer by Alan Turing in 1936, information technologies have constantly revolutionized science, the economy and now society as a whole.

Since the 1990's, we live times of uncertainty [@Perez2004]. The world is digitizing so rapidly that most users are scrambling to adapt [@Manyika2015]. Basically, the present period is defined as one of transition between two distinct technological styles -or techno-economic paradigms- and at the same time as the period of construction of a new mode of growth. Such long waves of technological change affect the whole system, the entire structure of society, worldwide. Technological change is a complex social process involving technical, economic, social and institutional factors in a mesh of interactions [@Perez2004].

There are mechanisms inherent to the way technologies diffuse which result in technological revolutions or changes of paradigm every fifty or sixty years. This results in long term patterns of continuity and discontinuity in the techno-economic sphere which require matching transformations at the socio-institutional level. The general framework of socioeconomic regulation has a natural inertia. So, during paradigm transitions, there are very intense transformations in technology and the economy and a high level of inertia and confusion in the socio-institutional sphere. As a result, the social consequences of each transition are vast and profound, as is the human suffering [@Perez2004].

In each country, centrifugal trends generate unprecedented growth and wealth, at one end, and increasing poverty, deterioration and degradation, at the other [@Perez2004]. Digitization is happening unevenly, and users with advanced digital capabilities are capturing disproportionate benefits [@Manyika2015].

Those trends involve widespread unemployment; the obsolescence of qualifications at all levels, the geographic dislocation of people and activities; the growth of rapid wealth at one end and of growing poverty at the other [@Perez2004]. There will be more economic dislocation : the day-to-day nature of work will change, companies redefine many roles and job displacement rates could accelerate sharply over the next decade [@Manyika2015].

Also a new and more pervasive dynamic appears to be at work : the gap between the digital "haves" and "have-mores" is growing as the most advanced users pull away from everyone else [@Manyika2015].

Today the race is on to capture value from data analytics and the Internet of Things, but there is no finish line : Digitization involves continuously experimenting and adapting [@Manyika2015].
