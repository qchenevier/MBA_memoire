### [The Future of Employment: How susceptible are jobs to computerization?][a8412bad]

Criteria:

- Routine vs Non-routine
- Cognitive vs Manual

Non-routine: legal writing, truck driving, medical diagnoses, persuading...

High probability of digitization:

- Routine intensive occupations = well-defined procedures

Low probability of digitization:

- Services: because of higher degree of flexibility and physical adaptability
- Cognitive jobs

Low Probability of offshoring:

- specific work location needed
- face-to-facepersonal communication required

Beware: activity that can be offshored != activity that can be automated. E.g.: cashier not offshorable but replaced by self-service technology.

> The Idea that technological advances favor more skilled workers is a twentieth century phenomenon. [^acemoglu]

3 Tasks categories which won't be automated:

- Perception & Manipulation tasks: in unstructured work environment (personal house vs airport or train station), irregular objects.
- Creative Intelligence tasks: it's making unfamiliar combinations fo familiar ideas and find which ones make sense. E.g: jokes. Value is creativity is inherently subjective, so evaluation of a robot on creative Intelligence tasks is not possible.
- Social intelligence tasks: involving negociation, persuasion and care.

Examples:

Category                    | Max              | Min
--------------------------- | ---------------- | ------------
Social intelligence         | Public relations | Dishwasher
Creativity                  | Fashion Designer | Count Clerk
Perception and manipulation | Surgeon          | Telemarketer
