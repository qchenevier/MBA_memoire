### Dimensions

Opportunities and threats:

- **Enhancing interactions** among customers, suppliers, stakeholders, and employees
- **Improving management decisions** as algorithms crunch big data from social technologies or the Internet of Things
- **Enabling new business or operating models**, such as peer-to-peer product innovation or customer service

7 forces at work:

1. New pressure on prices and margins
1. Competitors emerge from unexpected places
1. Winner-takes-all dynamics
1. Plug-and-play business models
1. Growing talent mismatches
1. Converging global supply and demand
1. Relentlessly evolving business models at higher velocity


Managing the strategic challenges: Six big decisions

- Decision 1: Buy or sell businesses in your portfolio?
- Decision 2: Lead your customers or follow them?
- Decision 3: Cooperate or compete with new attackers? (link with @Iansiti2014: GE's doing more partnerships)
- Decision 4: Diversify or double down on digital initiatives? (_potential_ link with @Woodard2013: Augment the design capital by augmenting the options or diminish the technical debt)
- Decision 5: Keep digital businesses separate or integrate them with current nondigital ones? (link with @Karimi2015: depending on the characteristics (size, existing assets, agility needed, risk aversion...), some have integrated or not the digital business unit)
- Decision 6: Delegate or own the digital agenda?

3 Tasks categories which won't be automated:

- **Creative Intelligence** tasks: it's making unfamiliar combinations for familiar ideas and find which ones make sense. E.g: jokes. Value is creativity is inherently subjective, so evaluation of a robot on creative Intelligence tasks is not possible.
- **Social intelligence** tasks: involving negotiation, persuasion and care.
