#### How Competitive Forces Shape Strategy [@Porter1979]

##### Dimensions

**Threat of entry**

Factors hindering new entrants:

1. Product differentiation
1. Cost disadvantages independent of size: experience, location, specific resources
1. Concentration: Economies of scale
1. Access to distribution channels
1. Capital requirements
1. Government policy

**Powerful suppliers & buyers**

Factor:
- Concentration of buyer/seller
- Differentiation of products bought/sold
- Buyer/seller is a Potential entrant
- Non-core to the buyer/seller
- High Marginal Cost to the buyer

**Substitute products**

Substitute products that deserve the most attention strategically are those that:

- are subject to trends improving their price-performance trade-off with the industry's product
- are produced by industries earning high profits.

**Jockeying for position**

- Concentration: Numerous or similarly sized rivals.
- Low growth of industry
- No differentiation or switching costs.
- High fixed costs or exit barriers.
- Nemesis: rivals having differing "personalities".

**Formulation of Strategy**

- Positioning the company
- Influencing the balance
- Exploiting industry change

#### Strategic principles for competing in the digital age [@Hirt2014]

##### Dimensions

Opportunities and threats:

- **Enhancing interactions** among customers, suppliers, stakeholders, and employees
- **Improving management decisions** as algorithms crunch big data from social technologies or the Internet of Things
- **Enabling new business or operating models**, such as peer-to-peer product innovation or customer service

7 forces at work:

1. New pressure on prices and margins
1. Competitors emerge from unexpected places
1. Winner-takes-all dynamics
1. Plug-and-play business models
1. Growing talent mismatches
1. Converging global supply and demand
1. Relentlessly evolving business models at higher velocity


Managing the strategic challenges: Six big decisions

- Decision 1: Buy or sell businesses in your portfolio?
- Decision 2: Lead your customers or follow them?
- Decision 3: Cooperate or compete with new attackers? (link with @Iansiti2014: GE's doing more partnerships)
- Decision 4: Diversify or double down on digital initiatives? (_potential_ link with @Woodard2013: Augment the design capital by augmenting the options or diminish the technical debt)
- Decision 5: Keep digital businesses separate or integrate them with current nondigital ones? (link with @Karimi2015: depending on the characteristics (size, existing assets, agility needed, risk aversion...), some have integrated or not the digital business unit)
- Decision 6: Delegate or own the digital agenda?

| Social intelligence         | Public relations | Dishwasher   |
| Creativity                  | Fashion Designer | Count Clerk  |
| Perception and manipulation | Surgeon          | Telemarketer |

3 Tasks categories which won't be automated:

- **Perception & Manipulation** tasks: in unstructured work environment (personal house vs airport or train station), irregular objects.
- **Creative Intelligence** tasks: it's making unfamiliar combinations for familiar ideas and find which ones make sense. E.g: jokes. Value is creativity is inherently subjective, so evaluation of a robot on creative Intelligence tasks is not possible.
- **Social intelligence** tasks: involving negotiation, persuasion and care.

#### Shaping the Future: Seven Enduring Principles for Fast-changing Industries [@Gimpel2012]

Information goods, powerful computing devices, and inexpensive digital communication is changing business and society through five digital forces

- Globalization
- Millennialization
- Prosumerization
- Business virtualization
- Platformization

PSD framework to assess the type of activity in the value stream:

- Production
- Search
- Delivery

VRIN framework to assess the value of an activity/resource:

- Valuable
- Rare
- Inimitable
- Non-substitutable

7 principles:

- Stop staring in the mirror
- Disrupt yourself
- Join them to beat them
- If it's not VRIN, it's out
- Produce, search, and/or deliver
- Value creation is the new structure
- Platforms are the future systems of engagement

#### The Role of Dynamic Capabilities in Responding to Digital Disruption: A Factor-Based Study of the Newspaper Industry [@Karimi2015]

Determinants of first-order dynamic capabilities:

- Resources: They are intangible in nature and must be built and cultivated over time.
  - Dedicated financial resources (DFR)
  - Dedicated human resources (DHR)
  - Senior management support (SMS)
- Processes: They are the fundamental building blocks of organizational capability and competitive advantage.
  - Staged allocation of resources (SAR)
  - Autonomous growth group (ACG)
- Values: They are the primary building-blocks for culture, which is the pattern of shared values, norms, and practices that distinguishes one organization from another.
  - Innovative culture (IC)
  - Common language (CL)
  - Multimedia mindset (MM)

#### Design Capital and Design Moves: the Logic of Digital Business Strategy [@Woodard2013]

Design capital:

- Option value
- Technical debt

Important contingencies:

- Resource munificence: organisational slack available
- Technical capability
- Ability to transfer the technical debt to the ecosystem

Design capital states and strategies:

- Option-constrained Design Capital: low option value & low technical debt.
  - if resource abundance, create design options
  - if resource scarcity, increase technical debt
- Debt-constrained Design Capital. high option value, high technical debt.
  - if resource scarcity, abandon design options
  - if resource abundant, reduce technical debt
- Low-quality Design Capital. low option value, high technical debt.
  - if resource scarcity, "pull the plug"
  - if resource abundance and high technical capability, reduce technical debt
  - if resource abundance and low technical capability, create design options
- High-quality Design Capital. high option value, low technical debt.
  - if resource scarcity and high ability to transfer technical debt to its ecosystem, increase technical debt
  - if resource scarcity and low ability to transfer technical debt to its ecosystem, abandon design options
  - if resource abundance, experimentation & entrepreneurial actions
