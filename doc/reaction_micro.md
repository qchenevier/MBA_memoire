### Better information processing from humans

#### 2-way communication instead of 1-way broadcast: Learn to listen

**Customer understanding:** Firms are exploring social media to understand customer satisfiers and dissatisfiers. Companies are learning to promote their brands more effectively through digital media: social media campaign, educational digital tools, building new on-line communities. Firms are building analytics capability to understand customers and actively conducting experiments in pricing and promotion [@Westerman2011].

**Top-line growth:** Companies are using technology to enhance in-person sales conversations. Using tablet-based presentations and introducing mobile tools to help sales people and customers engage in analytics-based planning. Analytics help to segment clients. Other firms are using concept stores as flagships for their digital selling innovations. Some firms try to make the life of the customer easier, simplifying their processes through a digital plugin. This streamlines the shopping process [@Westerman2011].

**Customer touch points:** Fast and transparent problem resolution builds trust for customers (for example, through a twitter account to answer client complaints). Companies with multiple channels to the customer are experiencing pressure to provide an integrated experience. Some firms are moving beyond simple multi-channel models to enable new forms of digital strategy: they supplements the multichannel experience through a new type of storefront. Several companies are offering self-service via digital tools. These tools allow the customer to save time, while saving the company money [@Westerman2011].

**Worker enablement:** Once-novel technologies such as mobile e-mail, collaboration tools, and video conferencing have now become the norm. Individual level work has, in essence, been virtualized, separating the work process from the location of the work. A firm redesigned its headquarters so that nobody had an assigned desk, even the CEO. Collaboration and networking tools allow employees to talk with anyone in the company. The tools that virtualize individual work, while implemented for cost reasons, have become powerful enablers for knowledge sharing: employees can identify experts and get questions answered in real time [@Westerman2011].

- **Culture issues:** On another level, previously autonomous country managers require coaching to grow comfortable working in an environment of centralized shared services and standardized processes [@Westerman2011].

#### Learning as value.

There is a creation of new occupations : skills and continuous learning matter more than ever [@Manyika2015].

- **Solution delivery:** Development methods in place are often geared to well-defined requirements and mature technologies but not to emerging digital technologies. Mobile and social media require iterative approaches to learn about what will work in the market. Digital Transformation use technology that is not commonly available in enterprises. Analytics activities often require specific knowledge and temperaments that typical IT developers do not possess [@Westerman2011].

Values: They are the primary building-blocks for culture, which is the pattern of shared values, norms, and practices that distinguishes one organization from another [@Karimi2015].

Values are defined as standards by which employees make priorisation decisions. Innovation requires firms to build and sustain an innovation-supportive culture. Innovative culture derives from values that reinforces the daily practices [@Karimi2015].

Innovative culture (IC): It defines or constrains what an organization can or cannot do, and as such can be a disability when confronting a new innovation. It can stimulate innovative behavior among members of an organization. It can lead an organization to accept innovation as one of its basic values and can foster commitment to it [@Karimi2015].

Common language (CL): It can facilitate change and overcome some of the barriers that make responding to innovation difficult. It can create a shared perspective to dramatically change the way organizations think and strengthen their ability to identify and develop new ideas. It can help to hardwire new concepts into the organization by the repeated use of terms such as "JOBS-to-be-done"; "good enough"; "invest a little, learn a lot" [@Karimi2015].

Multimedia mindset (MM): It actively expands newspaper companies' foci to include a multi-platform approach to serving consumers. It needs to permeate all aspects of a newspaper company and its overall mission. It must take hold institutionally, across the entire organization, and personally, in those leading the transformation [@Karimi2015].

Include a multi-platform or platform-free mindset by considering all forms of content [@Karimi2015].

Developing a digital-first mindset, making digital strategy everyone's job, cultivating an open culture that embraces digital innovations [@Karimi2015].

Organizations need to find out whether their values give them the priority they need to reconfigure their capabilities. If not, values need to be changed first, since values ultimately determine what processes are in place [@Karimi2015].

Adopt a multimedia mindset and view [your] business as a portfolio of products and services with different business models, pricing, and distribution strategies. A mindset that does not favor the status quo [@Karimi2015].

#### Deploy technologies to augment information processing skills

How four digital technologies (analytics, mobile, social media, and embedded devices) are being used in the enterprise. Analytics, Mobile and Social Media are widespread in large organizations. Customer-experience applications of social media are more common than internal uses, reflecting skepticism about how effective they will be for internal collaboration. Analytics, too, are more common in customer experience applications, reflecting organizations' increasing efforts to target marketing activities and personalize customer experience. Mobile is used widely in both domains. Embedded devices are still an emerging technology [@Westerman2011].

Three levels of usage: [@Westerman2011]
- **Substitution** is replacement for substantially the same function
- **Extension** is significantly improving performance or functionality
- **Breakthrough** is fundamentally redefining a process or function

Each is being used to improve customer experience or internal operations. The most common usage of each technology is in substitution. 30 percent of firms are engaging in extension or transformation with Mobile, Social, or Analytics. Usage of embedded devices lags the other technologies. An interesting trend toward transformative opportunities is combining multiple technologies with new management practices. Remote-control equipment and automated factories include both mobile and analytics technologies to improve production. Mobile phones are becoming embedded devices for customer-facing applications. Another firm integrates its social and web-based marketing approaches with its digital product design capabilities and embedded devices in products to be more responsive to emerging consumer preferences. Concept stores combine multiple technologies to test or deliver a new buying experience. [@Westerman2011]

#### Decision-making: Step up your game: Integration and speed

**Performance management:** Performance transparency is a key highlight. Digital transformation is actually changing the process of strategic decision-making. Executives are more informed when making decisions and insights allow decisions to be made on real data and not on assumptions. "We can use data to make better decisions about how we prioritize".  For example, some executives used the company's existing collaboration tools to extend strategic planning sessions from 12 people to more than 300 of the firm's top managers. This enabled better input into the process and better uptake of the vision after decisions were made [@Westerman2011].

Speed of Decision Making: technology has allowed firms to speed up decisions that otherwise might be slowed due to information flows up and down the hierarchy through multiple layers of management. Leading companies have invested significantly to provide the capability to access diverse streams of information. Slowness in response could mean customers moving away from companies perceived as being out of tune with the new reality. But there are enormous challenges to access, process, and analyze the massive amounts of data that accumulate as a natural by-product of routine transactions. As companies make investments to process increased amounts of data, we find that few have made corresponding investments in the organizational processes to drive business value from data and information. The value lies not in investing in technology but in how increased access to information drives faster and more effective decisions [@Bharadwaj2013].


- **Digital globalization:** Local managers, empowered to make decisions autonomously, also gain a broader view of the business through centralized data, have freedom to tailor business to their local needs, but the responsibility to act in the interests of the larger enterprise.  [@Westerman2011]

- **Analytics capabilities:** Information management and analytics were highlighted as major goals by executives across industries. "It's time to harvest the data and turn it into insights." It is seen as a way to gain strategic advantage over competitors, by making more-informed and better decisions and reacting more quickly to changes [@Westerman2011].

- **Missing skills:** Analytics-based decision-making does not always come naturally to people accustomed to using "professional judgment" [@Westerman2011].

- **Culture issues:** Cultural issues can also become a bottleneck for digital transformation. A major cultural issue is related to changes in jobs due to automation or information empowerment. The firm's information-based benefits are reduced by managers who cannot think differently about how they make decisions [@Westerman2011].

- **Culture issues:** There is also a need to change the culture when empowering front-line workers. These workers needed help to adopt the idea of using new information capabilities to make autonomous decisions [@Westerman2011].

- **Governance challenges:** Benefiting from transformation typically requires changes in processes or decision-making that span traditional organizational or functional structures. Organizational change requires top-down effort to help employees envision a different reality. The largest benefits of digital transformation come from truly transforming activities. This requires a more radical vision: one that offers a view of a different way of working, not just a faster or more efficient one. Unless senior executives establish a transformative vision of the future, managers in the rest of the firm will tend to locally optimize within their own spheres of authority. Whereas an overarching vision can span organizational boundaries. Envisioning a single entity with local offices, rather than a collection of independent units, so that each can rapidly adjust to what is learned in another area. These overarching visions establish a picture of what is legitimate and help to delegitimize local behavior that detracts from a more global approach. More common than a lack of vision is a vision that does not go far enough. Overly limited visions can dramatically affect the value obtained from each digital transformation investment [@Westerman2011].

Common language for disruptive innovations are able to avoid some of the mental traps that make enabling response to digital disruption difficult. These traps include pursuing perfection when "good enough" is often sufficient, overestimating knowledge of new markets, and making big bets when it is better to begin with small ones [@Karimi2015].

One lever for change is to hire new leaders bringing new skills, also bringing a new vision. Senior executives cite a strong vision and frequent communication as essential for driving culture change. Labor relations issues are a stickier source of culture change issues. Employees, fearing job cuts, are strongly resistant [@Westerman2011].

### Leadership: guiding instead of controling

#### Leadership & Vision

Successful digital transformation comes not from implementing new technologies but from transforming your organization transformation initiatives are centered on re-envisioning customer experience, operational processes and business models. Digital Transformation does not happen bottom up. It must be driven from the top [@Westerman2011].

Focus on the "how" more than the "what." Successful transformations focus on how to drive change as on the detailed content of the change. A compelling transformative vision will allow people to identify new "whats" to meet or extend the vision [@Westerman2011].

Despite the hype around innovative digital technologies, most companies still have a long way to go in their digital transformation journeys. Leadership is essential. That's a management and people challenge, not just a technology one [@Westerman2011].

- **Lack of impetus:** Impetus often starts at the very top of the firm. Skepticism can result in bureaucratic investment processes that prevent the firm from engaging in useful digitally enabled experiments and business changes. "We've always been fairly slow in adopting technology because we more or less have the ambition of not being first, but we have become even slower at the same time that technology development has been speeding up." If the company is not experiencing pain, the perceived risk of change may outweigh the potential benefits in the minds of many executives [@Westerman2011].

- Decision 6: Delegate or own the digital agenda?
Advancing the digital agenda takes lots of senior-management time and attention. An effective digital strategy calls for extensive cross-functional orchestration that may require CEO involvement Faced with the need to sort through functional and regional issues related to digitization, some companies are creating a new role: chief digital officer (or the equivalent), a common way to introduce outside talent with a digital mindset to provide a focus for the digital agenda. Relying on chief digital officers to drive the digital agenda carries some risk of balkanization and they may also sacrifice the big picture for a narrower focus, say, on marketing or social media or lack the influence or authority to get support for execution from the functional units. CEOs can choose to "own" and direct the digital agenda personally, top down [@Hirt2014].

- **Coordination issues:** Many firms fail to transform because of coordination difficulties across business units or processes. Units are able to make progress in their own areas, but are unable to influence practices in other units. A firm is even investing in coordination and created a digital division to ensure that all of its digital efforts are being coordinated. A further concern arises from coordination issues between new and traditional businesses or processes: conflict is real, and can be very painful for managers in traditional units that lose when new businesses gain. It often must be addressed through an overarching vision [@Westerman2011].

Senior management needs to go beyond words, and in addition to leaning back and reviewing improvements in the core products, senior management needs to lean forward and work on growth initiatives for non-core products [@Karimi2015].

Senior management support (SMS): It not only signals the importance of innovation to the organization but also helps innovative project teams clear the inevitable obstacles to success and harness senior management's wisdom to improve ideas. It supports activities for building an effective project coalition, developing and communicating a vision, and providing resources to support initiatives [@Karimi2015].

#### Small & independent units to experiment

Processes that govern investment decisions are the most crucial processes in which many organizations' most serious disabilities reside when attempting to respond to disruptive innovations [@Karimi2015].

Dedicated financial resources (DFR): Dedicating these resources to responding to digital disruption can facilitate new growth by avoiding the traps associated with allocating all slack resources to core products and by removing the obstacles that would otherwise limit the potential for innovative ideas to succeed [9, 63] [@Karimi2015].

Dedicated human resources (DHR): Relying just on human resources already allocated to the core products can sharply limit a newspaper company's ability to sell innovative non-core products and to capture new business models [@Karimi2015].

Autonomous growth group (AGG): It is essential for creating new processes or ways of working together because individuals of those groups or teams often do not represent their functional group interests. It is a necessary condition when a new venture needs to take an approach that the old venture dislikes or rejects, or when a new venture needs to create new growth that may disrupt the core business. Otherwise, chances are that either a low priority is assigned to new ideas or an old business model may be force-fitted onto the new opportunity [@Karimi2015].

Staged allocation of resources (SAR): It can force innovation teams to zero in quickly on critical assumptions, find cheap ways to test those assumptions, and develop lean and flexible structures for innovation projects. Instead of risking big investments on uncertain strategies, newspaper companies can "invest a little to learn a lot" about the key uncertainties in their approach, reduce the cost and risk of innovation, and encourage smart experiments and risk-mitigation strategies [@Karimi2015].

Staged allocation of funding resources allows for committing small amounts of resources to multiple innovation projects establishing an autonomous growth group, business unit, or "heavyweight" development team is essential for creating new processes or ways of working together because individuals of those groups or teams often do not represent their functional group interests [@Karimi2015].

#### Let structure emerge from value

Executives are beginning to envision possibilities that cross organizational and technological silos: letting the possibilities drive technology and organization rather than the reverse. [@Westerman2011]

Value creation is the new structure: Structures often become rigid, causing firms to define themselves by what they do, not how they add value. The structures imprudently shift the focus to creating profits for the firm instead of creating value for customers. A focus on value rather than structure frees enterprises to shake off the mentality of "that's not how we do business.". Companies can build a strong competitive offering around core and essential core support functions, while virtualizing other part of the business through outsourcing, partnerships, and strategic alliances [@Gimpel2012].

If it's not VRIN, it's out: Technological innovations can reshape value chains, causing once-strategic resources to lose their value, identify and build upon strategic resources that will remain valuable after the transition. It must be VRIN: valuable, rare, inimitable, and non-substitutable [@Gimpel2012].

Change the mindset of the marketing by switching: [@Iansiti2014]

_"We are trying to sell them something they don't know they need and they can't see when it works."_
- from the "box seller" mentality: "**features list** with pricing and discount caps"
- to a solution-based sales focused on pain points how to enhance **customer's operating performance**

### Other

Produce, search, and/or deliver: CIME firms create value by managing only three types of transactions: production, search, and delivery [@Gimpel2012].
- Production is "making goods available for use."
- Search is matching different parties together so they can trade
- Delivery is transmitting or communicating information and information goods
The PSD framework helps to identify and separate core revenue-generating transactions from supporting, non-core activities, distinctions that often become blurred after long periods of stability [@Gimpel2012].
CIME firms profit by reducing inefficiencies in production, search, and/or delivery. Disruptive innovations offer greater efficiency in these roles [@Gimpel2012].
