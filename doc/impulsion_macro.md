## Macro-economic scale

<!-- What are your assets in this environment? -->
<!-- Why some assets have less value than before? What assets are dealuating quickly? -->
<!-- How are you organized? -->

While physical processes have high marginal costs, low-marginal-cost economics and platform architecture has allowed the most successful high-tech firms to achieve a scale that was once impossible. The power of platform economics is reflected in the gross margins, which can run as high as 80 percent. [@Manyika2015]

Once digital players have established themselves as leaders in one market, they have a striking ability to move into new areas. [@Manyika2015]

Amazon went from selling books to selling every retail and a self-publishing platform and a cloud-based business service. [@Manyika2015]

Google went from internet search to longevity and biotech research, smart home products, venture capital investing and high-speed internet fiber services. [@Manyika2015]

Consider the automotive industry, Consumers now save time by comparing vehicles on-line and their on-line activity leaves a data trail that dealers can use. [@Manyika2015]

Information becomes widely available, disrupting traditional intermediaries: Value is shifting from physical intermediaries and asset holders to digital intermediaries and to consumers. [@Manyika2015]

The complex patterns of dynamic interdependencies among environmental turbulence, dynamic capabilities, and IT systems have resulted in the phenomenon called "digital ecodynamics". [@ElSawy2010]

The digital technologies underlying competitive threats may not be new, but they are being used to new effect. The "plug and play" nature of digital assets causes value chains to disaggregate, creating openings for focused, fast-moving competitors. [@Hirt2014]

Internet information is now cheap, open standards have also facilitated open distribution platforms which have further resulted in more flexibility for consumers. Aggregative news services are becoming more important intermediaries. [@Karimi2015]

Inexpensive digital information goods and computing and communication devices are changing society as a whole through five digital forces: globalization, millenialization, prosumerization, business virtualization, and platformization [@Gimpel2012].

A technology is considered disruptive when its use generates services or physical products with different performance attributes that may not be valued by a company's current customer base. Disruption, however, is not an event or immediate phenomenon but a process that may take several years or even decades. [@Karimi2015]

New market entrants often scale up rapidly at lower cost than legacy players can. Digital capabilities increasingly will determine which companies create or lose value. New trends emerge and disruptive entrants appear, their products and services embraced by early adopters. Advanced incumbents then begin to adjust to these changes, accelerating the rate of customer adoption until the industry's level of digitization, among companies but, perhaps more critically, among consumers as well, reaches a tipping point. Eventually, what was once radical is normal. [@Hirt2014]

Although large traditional firms are truly different from digital entrants, many are starting to transform their businesses successfully through digital technology. Companies face common pressures from customers, employees and competitors. [@Westerman2011]

Enabling new business or operating models, such as peer-to-peer product innovation (crowd-source features rather than investing heavily in R&D) or customer service (crowd-source customer service, so that users support each other to resolve problems), disintermediate existing customer-supplier relations. [@Hirt2014]

1. New pressure on prices and margins
Third parties have jumped into this fray, disintermediating relationships between companies and their customers. The rise of price-comparison sites and these dynamics create downward pressure on returns across consumer-facing industries, and the disruptive currents are now rippling out to B2B businesses. [@Hirt2014]

2. Competitors emerge from unexpected places
Digital dynamics often undermine barriers to entry and long-standing sources of product differentiation. Web-based service providers now tap markets without having to build distribution networks of offices. The expense of building brands on-line and the degree of consumer attention focused on a relatively small number of brands are redrawing battle lines in many markets. New competitors can often be smaller companies that will never reach scale but still do a lot of damage to incumbents. [@Hirt2014]

3. Winner-takes-all dynamics
Digital businesses reduce transaction and labor costs, increase returns to scale from aggregated data. Scale economies in data and talent often are decisive. [@Hirt2014]

4. Plug-and-play business models
As digital forces reduce transaction costs, value chains disaggregate. Amazon, for instance, offers businesses logistics, on-line retail "storefronts," and IT services. [@Hirt2014]

5. Growing talent mismatches
At the same time, companies are struggling to find the right talent in areas that can't be automated. Such areas include digital skills like those of artificial-intelligence programmers or data scientists and of people who lead digital strategies and think creatively about new business designs. One global company, for example, is simultaneously planning to cut more than 10,000 employees (some through digital economies) while adding 3,000 to its digital business. [@Hirt2014]

6. Converging global supply and demand
Digitization transforms global flows by vastly reducing marginal production and distribution costs in 3 ways: creation of purely digital goods (digitization is transforming even physical flows of people into virtual flows), enhancing the value of physical flows by the use of "digital wrappers" that pack information around (online reviews or customer ratings, digital tags and sensors connected by wireless communications), creation of on-line platforms that bring efficiency and speed to production and cross-border exchanges. [@Hirt2014]
In B2B markets, corporate purchasers are raising pressure on their suppliers to offer services that are standardized across borders, integrate with other offerings, and can be plugged into the purchasing companies' global business processes easily. [@Hirt2014]

Common pressures to begin digital transformation:
Nearly every executive cited competitive pressures to change. This relates closely to increases in the pace of business. Several executives indicated this was "the new normal" for their industries. None of the executives felt their innovation culture was as strong as it should be. [@Westerman2011]
Globalization is a driver for some firms: there is a strategic need to expand globally or pressures to generate information and process synergies. [@Westerman2011]
Some firms mentioned M&A as a pressure to transform. [@Westerman2011]

Different digital transformation speeds and different results:
Very few businesses are gaining the full value of technologically-enabled change. Manufacturers' ERP systems have improved process efficiency and are providing better financial data for strategic decisions, but companies have not yet retrained buyers in how to use the information in negotiating with suppliers. [@Westerman2011]
Some firms are conducting experiments in different business units, but not conducting a unified digital transformation of the customer experience. [@Westerman2011]

Innovation presents great challenges to executives in the communications, information, media, and entertainment (CIME) industries. (CIME) industries face dramatic changes in revenue streams and shifts in industry dynamics. Power players accustomed to monopoly profits face unprecedented competition. Traditional business models face threats. Communications firms face substitution from over-the-top services. [@Gimpel2012]

Information goods, powerful computing devices, and inexpensive digital communication is changing business and society through five digital forces: globalization, Millenialization, prosumerization, business virtualization, and platformization. [@Gimpel2012]

Globalization reshapes the nature of supply and demand. Consumers enjoy a new world of choice
Millennialization of consumers has turned consumers into producers, empowered individuals to share their voices and influence others
Prosumerization has lowered the break-even point for producers and given birth to low-overhead startups that can compete directly with capital-intensive incumbents
Business virtualization: firms can reduce costs, increase agility, and boost quality by partnering with outside firms
Platformization: Digital platforms bring together suppliers, customers, and third parties and are replacing traditional middlemen and can often serve to level the playing field by granting small players and new entrants access to formerly closed markets
