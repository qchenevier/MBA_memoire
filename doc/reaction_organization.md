## Organizations' reaction

<!-- What shift in business model? -->
<!-- What assez will you reuse? -->
<!-- How is moving the market? -->
<!-- How do you restructure your company? -->

@Perez2004 analyses each techno-economic paradigm through three inter-related levels:

- New "best practice" model : flexible organizational model
- New "common sense" principles for organizational & institutional design : decentralization, networking, continuous improvement, users/stakeholders involvement in the organization

Firms are experiencing different digital transformation speeds and different results:
Very few businesses are gaining the full value of technologically-enabled change. Manufacturers' ERP systems have improved process efficiency and are providing better financial data for strategic decisions, but companies have not yet retrained buyers in how to use the information in negotiating with suppliers [@Westerman2011].
Some firms are conducting experiments in different business units, but not conducting a unified digital transformation of the customer experience [@Westerman2011].



### Assess your organizational value

#### Assess your internal & absolute value: your assets

**Identify and diagnose strategic assets:** Large companies survive major transitions not by radically replacing the old with the new, but rather by transforming some of their existing resources and competencies for the new environment and reassigning or adapting assets and realigning or re-motivating employees. Your company will thrive in digital transformation not by doing something completely new, but by taking advantage of your powerful capabilities to gain advantage through digitization. What assets will be useful in a digitally transformed world [@Westerman2011]?

Successful Digital Transformation comes from reshaping the organization to take advantage of valuable existing strategic assets in new ways, to gain value from investments they have already made [@Westerman2011].

Beware of the assumption: **The strategic assets that brought us success in the physical world will also be valuable in the digital environment.** Look for ways to leverage assets that you have and that fast-moving digital startups do not. Use these to establish and grow your digital advantage [@WESTERMAN2015].


#### Analyze your business model: Assets and Rights sold

Surprisingly, we found there is no universally accepted definition of the important concept of a business model. Our business model framework is based on defining the types of assets a company sells and the rights it grants customers to use those assets. We define four asset types and four ways companies manage asset rights to generate revenue [@PeterWeill2011].

The four asset types are [@PeterWeill2011]:

- Financial assets, which include cash as well as securities like stocks, bonds and insurance policies
- Physical assets, which include durable items such as computers, as well as nondurable items such as food
- Intangible assets, which include intellectual property such as patents and copyrights, as well as other intangible assets like knowledge, goodwill and brand value
- Human assets, which include people's time and effort. People of course cannot be legally bought and sold, but their time and knowledge can be "rented out" for a fee.

The four rights types sold [@PeterWeill2011]:

- Creators, which sell ownership of products they have created
- Distributors, which sell ownership of products they bought
- Landlords, which sell only the right to use assets for a specified period of time
- Brokers, which receive a fee for matching buyers and sellers without ever taking ownership or custody of the product

Produce, search, and/or deliver: CIME firms create value by managing only three types of transactions: production, search, and delivery [@Gimpel2012]:

- Production is "making goods available for use."
- Search is matching different parties together so they can trade
- Delivery is transmitting or communicating information and information goods

The PSD framework helps to identify and separate core revenue-generating transactions from supporting, non-core activities, distinctions that often become blurred after long periods of stability [@Gimpel2012].
CIME firms profit by reducing inefficiencies in production, search, and/or delivery. Disruptive innovations offer greater efficiency in these roles [@Gimpel2012].

Combining those 2 frameworks, it seems that:

- Search is the activity of Brokers.
- Production is the activity of Creators.
- Delivery is activity of Landlords and Distributors.

Examples:

- Telecom carriers and Internet Service Providers
  - Delivery of Intangible knowledge
  - Landlords of Physical Telecommunications Infrastructure.
- Apple's Iphone sold in an Apple store
  - Production and Delivery of Physical Iphone
  - Creator and Distributor of Physical Iphone
- Apple's Iphone leased by a telecom carrier
  - Delivery of Physical Iphone
  - Landlord of Physical Iphone
- Plane ticket by Airline Company
  - Delivery of Human flight crew and Physical plane seat
  - Landlord of Physical plane seat and Human flight crew
- Display of ads by Google
  - Production & Delivery of Intangible ad space
  - Creator & Landlord of Intangible ad space
  - Search between Audience and Advertiser for Intangible ad space
  - Broker between Audience and Advertiser for Intangible ad space

Value Appropriation through Control of Digital Industry Architecture: Apple has a smaller market share but leads in profit share in the mobile industry because it receives a share of the follow-on revenue that the telecom carriers earn from the end users. Apple’s appeal to the end consumer is arguably higher. This control of the industry architecture allows Apple to extract a higher premium [@Bharadwaj2013]. Similarly, Apple receives payments from Google so that he can remain the default search engine on Apple mobile devices, powered by its propietary operating system, [according to some experts](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/08/14/google-paying-apple-3-billion-to-remain-default-search--bernstein.html). In this example, Apple is controlling the distribution to its captive users and selling it to suppliers.

@Iansiti2014 defines a business model (a bit simplistically) by these 2 diemsntions: how the organization **creates** value for its customers & how the organization **captures** that value.

Digital transformation changes both: GE creates values by extracting useful data from sensors, by optimizing equipment performance, utilization and maintenance. It captures that value by charging a percentage of the customer's incremental revenue from improved performance [@Iansiti2014]. On one hand, GE is improving its Product Leadership with innovations and optimizations on its product, on the other hand, GE is improving its Customer Intimacy by tailoring its marketing to the client needs.

We can see how GE has shifted its business model: GE is still producing the same type of asset (even if they are improved by digitalization) which are physical goods, but it has changed the type of rights it is selling: GE is not uniquely a Producer, it is also a Landlord. Being a Landlord of the physical goods it produces is a way for GE to gather more easily usage data and to feedback the improvement of its physical goods products.  

#### Low marginal costs economics: Production & Distributions marginal costs are running towards zero

The fact that Information can be duplicated infinitely and freely enables low marginal cost economics: past the initial investment, the production & distribution cost tend towards zero. Global flows of products & services are more and more digital.

**Low-marginal costs:** Information is costly to produce but cheap to reproduce. Economists say that production of an information good involves high fixed costs but low marginal costs. The cost of producing the first copy of an information good may be substantial, but the cost of producing (or reproducing) additional copies is negligible [@Shapiro1999].

According to @Hirt2014, Digitization transforms global flows by vastly reducing marginal production and distribution costs in 3 ways:

- creation of purely digital goods (digitization is transforming even physical flows of people into virtual flows)
- enhancing the value of physical flows by the use of "digital wrappers" that pack information around (online reviews or customer ratings, digital tags and sensors connected by wireless communications)
- creation of on-line platforms that bring efficiency and speed to production and cross-border exchanges [@Hirt2014].

Some authors are even saying that there is a drive To Demonetization: These days, product development cycles are measured not in months or quarters, but in hours or days. The most important achievements of the Internet during the last decade was that it cut the marginal cost of marketing and sales to nearly zero. It is possible to promote an online product worldwide for a tiny fraction of what it cost just twenty-five years ago. Customer acquisition costs can also be cut to what was once deemed impossible: zero. The new information-enabled technologies will power exponential cost drops not just in sales and marketing, but also across every business function [@VanGeest2014].

For example, specifically for Information Technology, the investment in spending on IT hardware, software, services, telecommunications and staff that could be considered the "infrastructure" of the digital universe and telecommunications will grow by 40% between 2012 and 2020 but the investment per gigabyte (GB) during that same period will drop from \$2.00 to \$0.20 [@Gantz2012].

Those trends are generalizable to all industries, such as industries with primarily physical products (such as consumer or industrial products), those with mixed digital and physical products (such as consumer electronics, automotive, health care), and those with primarily digital products (such as financial markets, music, software applications). To capture the value from digital transformation, firms need to go beyond small applications and toward truly digital enterprises [@Karimi2015].

As seen in the study of @PeterWeill2011, Investors have prefered Firms and Business Models which have exploiting the low marginal costs economics of Information:

- Manufacturers are generally highly valued by investors, with manufacturers who innovate even more highly valued [@PeterWeill2011]. We can understand this trend by 2 trends in physical goods manufacturing:

  - either they augment their product with low-marginal-costs intangible assets: the Apple Iphone wouldn't have any value without the application store. GE's has added sensors to its products to gather and exploit usage data to help improve operational excellence of users [@Iansiti2014].
  - or they lower their marginal cost by improving their operational excellence through digitalization, like automating production tasks and outsourcing production to more efficient players: Apple is outsourcing its production to Foxconn which invests heavily in robots to replace its workers [@Zuo2016]. In the end, the physical product innovation is tending toward reducing the marginal costs of production.

- IP landlords were the second-highest performing [@PeterWeill2011]. Licensing IP is a business model with very low marginal costs.

Whereas business models with high marginal costs were seen as not performant enough for investors:

- Contractors (that primarily "rent out" human assets) had performance in the middle of the pack [@PeterWeill2011].

- Financial and physical landlords were the poorest performing of the common business models [@PeterWeill2011]. Finance asset are a special type of Information-based asset which doesn't benefit of low marginal cost economics, because Money is "engineered" to maintain its value overtime (according to the main [properties of money](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money#Properties)) and hence cannot be duplicated infinitely and freely. We can ever create new Information, except for Money, where the creation mechanisms are carefully monitored.  

#### Data as a digital asset that grow in value through combination

Data should be considered an asset class in its own right and analytics are useful for more than just optimizing business processes. Equally important is the role of assets in your business model. Traditional companies are taking a fresh look at how they can use the assets they own in new ways to participate in today's "sharing economy" [@WESTERMAN2015].

Access resources you don't own. In Waze's case, the company made use of the GPS readings already on its users' smartphones. Information is your greatest asset. More reliably than any other asset, information has the potential to double regularly. Rather than simply assembling assets, the key to success is accessing valuable caches of existing information [@VanGeest2014].

#### Investing, Financing, Divesting

We need a reconceptualization of the role of digital connections within a firm’s corporate portfolio of products and services (its scope) to better prescribe its digital business strategy  [@Bharadwaj2013].

**How Will You Finance the Digital Transformation Endeavor?** If a company is already financially struggling, its options for financing digital transformations will be severely limited [@Hess2016].

**Buy or sell businesses in your portfolio?** The growth and profitability of some businesses become less attractive in a digital world, and the capabilities needed to compete change as well. Companies that lack sufficient scale or expect a significant digital downside should consider divesting businesses [@Hirt2014].

**Financial Aspects Dimension:** Increasing financial pressure on the current core business might be the trigger that convinces management of the need for action [@Hess2016].

**How Strong is the Financial Pressure on Your Current Core Business?** The willingness of top management to undertake the necessary efforts for, and accept the ensuing risks of, digital transformation endeavors often depends on the competitiveness of the current core business. Managers may not see the urgency for embarking on digital transformation. However, markets can change quickly and acting too late can be fatal [@Hess2016].

### Update the organization's information processing

Approaching Digital Ubiquity [@Iansiti2014]

- Apply the digital lens to existing products & services
- Connect your existing assets across companies
- Examine new modes of value creation
- Consider new value-capture modes
- Use software to extend the boundaries of what you do.

#### Convergence IT and business

Rather than using armies of people or large physical plants, Exponential Organizations are built upon information technologies that take what was once physical in nature and dematerialize it into the digital, on-demand world.

Firms pursuing digital business strategies must manage a fundamental tension between the need to support flexible adaptation of their products and services to changing market conditions, and the need to provide stable value appropriation mechanisms to extract economic rents and reinvest them in innovative activities. Companies often fuse IT with their products and services for competitive advantage [@Woodard2013].

Over time, as firms and industries become more digital and rely on information, communication, and connectivity functionality, we envision that digital business strategy will be the business strategy. At that juncture, there would be no separation between business strategy and digital business strategy. (link with [@Perez2004] with _old vs new common sense_) [@Bharadwaj2013]

Digital ecodynamics requires a holistic convergence among dynamic capabilities, IT systems, and environmental turbulence [@Karimi2015].

It is time to fusion between IT strategy and business strategy into an overarching phenomenon we herein term digital business strategy [@Bharadwaj2013].

Digital Business Strategy is an organizational strategy formulated and executed by leveraging digital resources to create differential value [@Bharadwaj2013].

By recognizing the pervasiveness of digital resources in operations, purchasing, supply chain & marketing and going beyond systems and technologies, to recognize digital resources, in line with the resource-based view of strategy [@Bharadwaj2013].

Digital business strategy can be viewed as being inherently transfunctional, with digital resources serving as the connective tissue [@Bharadwaj2013].

**Business and IT integration:** Companies with a history of strained IT and business relationships are handicapped when trying to conduct digital transformation, because of complex IT architectures, unintegrated data, and processes that are not well-enabled through technology. In contrast, companies with a solid IT-business relationship are in a solid position to begin digital transformation. Where strong relationships exist, executives on both sides of the relationship are willing to be flexible in creating new governance mechanisms or digital units without feeling threatened. In most firms, digital transformation is being led by CIOs. Other companies place responsibility for digital in another unit or executive who works closely with the CIO. Another solution is to hire a second CIO to focus on transformation-related activities, working in concert with the CIO who stays focused on keeping the firms' existing platform functional [@Westerman2011].

**Keep digital businesses separate or integrate them with current nondigital ones?** Integrating digital operations directly into physical businesses can create additional value, for example, by providing multichannel capabilities for customers or by helping companies share infrastructure, such as supply-chain networks. However, it can be hard to attract and retain digital talent in a traditional culture, and turf wars between the leaders of the digital and the main business are commonplace. Hybrid approaches involving both stand-alone and well-integrated digital organizations are possible, of course, for companies with diverse business portfolios [@Hirt2014].

Most IT strategies treat technology in isolation, they often lack the transformational, business-centric orientation needed to realize the potential within a company's business model, products, processes and organizational structures. A digital transformation strategy signposts the way toward digital transformation and guides managers through the transformation process resulting from the integration and use of digital technologies and helps them navigate the complexity and ambiguity of identifying their own digital "sweet spots." [@Hess2016]

**Do You Plan to Integrate New Operations into Existing Structures or Create Separate Entities?** Decide whether to integrate new operations into their current operations or to organize them as distinct, separate units (perhaps as a newly formed subsidiary). Integration requires less extensive restructuring efforts, but it is important to examine whether synergies can be exploited. Organizing new digital activities in separate structures makes it easier to explicitly separate (physically and ideologically) old and new operations. Appropriate structures for new operations are more innovative and provide an increased level of flexibility. The greater the distance between digital transformation efforts and a firm's current core activities, the stronger the boundary between new and old operations should be. Digital transformation initiatives often involve significant innovation and change efforts, as well as a willingness to take risks, all of which may be difficult to accommodate within existing organizational structures [@Hess2016].

#### Digital platforms as a central tool for future products (design capital with high option value)

Digital business strategy relies on rich information exchanges through digital platforms inside and outside organizations that allow multifunctional strategies and processes to be tightly interconnected [@Bharadwaj2013].

The majority (78 percent) of the effect of first-order dynamic capabilities on response performance is achieved indirectly through building digital platform capabilities when it comes to producing digital non-core products. The same effect is achieved mostly directly when it comes to percentage of revenue coming from all on-line sources. The number of digital non-core products is more directly impacted by digital platform capabilities than by first-order dynamic capabilities. The percentage of revenue from on-line sources is more directly impacted by first-order dynamic capabilities than by building digital platform capabilities [@Karimi2015].

Rather than investing in the status quo, resources need to be appropriately allocated to build digital platform capabilities for new markets and value networks [@Karimi2015].

Organizations need to find out whether processes for their core products are appropriate for developing digital non-core products [@Karimi2015].

Developing digital non-core products requires new digital platform capabilities. Platforms are the building blocks that act as a foundation for developing complementary products, technologies, or services. Digital platforms organize IT capabilities into software frameworks for integration of transactions. Digital platform capabilities provide standards, connectivity, rules, and IT capabilities [@Karimi2015].

**Unified Data and Processes:** The most fundamental technology need for digital transformation is a digital platform of integrated data and processes. The difficulty of operating without a platform becomes greater as companies engage in multi-channel operations. "Data integration is the biggest challenge in setting up our digital services." Unified data and process is one reason that web-based companies are able to gain advantage through analytics and personalization much more readily than traditional firms. Unified platforms can also help to manage the centralization-decentralization challenge [@Westerman2011].

One of the first thing deployed in the new GE Software HQ by the new Digital Officer to start building software capabilities:

- creation of a **common software platform** [@Iansiti2014]
- "**Co-location** is everything" [@Iansiti2014]

#### Digital capabilities are the people working around that platform to improve it

Technical capability, or the ability to deploy needed technical skills in executing a design move, emerged in our analysis as an important contingency. We observed instances in which organizations with abundant resources were still constrained by the level of technical capability [@Woodard2013].

**Digital capabilities:** Digital capabilities cut across all three pillars. They are a fundamental building block for transformation in customer experience, operational processes, and business models. Although CIOs and existing IT departments are leading digital initiatives across companies, they hire extra skills or implement separate units to coordinate digital transformation [@Westerman2011].

Scale with Digital Business Strategy Will Increasingly Take Place under Conditions of Information Abundance: develop the organizational capabilities to harness the huge quantities of heterogeneous data, which includes the explosive chatter on social networks, crowdsourcing of ideas from the edges of networks, and the proliferation of billions of continuous machine-to-machine sensors [@Bharadwaj2013].

**Solution delivery:** Companies also need the capabilities to modify their processes or build new methods onto the data and process platform. Some IT departments have established special units to build emerging technology skills and methods. Others look outside the firm for help: Vendor partners can be very effective, but some executives expressed concern about over-reliance on vendors. Several executives described knowledge gaps that existed after they ended a vendor relationship [@Westerman2011].

**Algorithms:** The world is pretty much run on algorithms. Machine Learning is the ability to accurately perform new, unseen tasks, built on known properties learned from training or historic data. ExOs need to follow four steps [@VanGeest2014]:
1. Gather: The algorithmic process starts with harnessing data, which is gathered via sensors or humans, or imported from public datasets.
2. Organize: The next step is to organize the data, a process known as ETL (extract, transform and load).
3. Apply: Once the data is accessible, machine learning tools identify trends and tune new algorithms.
4. Expose: The final step is exposing the data, as if it were an open platform. Open data and APIs can be used to enable an ExO’s community to develop valuable services.

**Analytics capabilities:**  Companies with integrated data are able to engage in more powerful analytics strategies. All executives also mentioned that building analytics capability was difficult, requiring skills and culture change in addition to investments [@Westerman2011].

**IT Difficulties:** Digital initiatives are built on a solid foundation of technology-enabled processes and data, as well as the analytics, solution delivery and relationship capabilities to create and extend that platform. Many companies find their information technology infrastructures and capabilities severely lacking. "We don't retire systems. We just add on top of them, which creates a tremendous amount of expense and complexity." "It is very difficult to get a good understanding of the customer when customer data is spread across so many systems." A history of poor business / IT relations is a difficult foundation for the collaborative work required in digital transformation. "IT is a mess. Their costs are not acceptable. They propose things in 9-10 months where external firms could do them in 3-9 weeks [@Westerman2011].

Build or buy the capabilities of the future. Companies cannot afford to fall behind in critical capabilities. M&A is becoming a way to head off future competitors by buying them. Recent deals would not pass the traditional valuation filter, but the need to execute a rapid strategy may call for different metrics [@Manyika2015].

**Missing skills:** Emerging technologies are another area where skills may be scarce internally, especially in areas such as mobility and social media. Firms are filling gaps by hiring experts or working with vendors. A firm of the study, aiming to limit long-term HR investment while experimenting with new technologies, is working with vendors who have the right skills. However, it is encountering knowledge integration issues as key skills are located in different vendors [@Westerman2011].

Building software capabilities [@Iansiti2014]

- Problems encountered:
  - Process: GE has never been known for its agility. 80% the software products they edited were not profitable. "It was taking us **years to build the software and years to get it out the door**" [@Iansiti2014]
  - Developer Talent: Most of their developers had experience with outdated technologies. They were **reliant on outside vendors**, sometimes for full development [@Iansiti2014].
- Solutions deployed new GE Software HQ:
  - "**Co-location** is everything" [@Iansiti2014]
  - creation of a **common software platform** [@Iansiti2014]
  - **No enforcement of compliance**: "We are going to do this, you can be on the train or not".
  - No dedicated P&L for the software: **Different incentives** that don't create competition with the businesses [@Iansiti2014].

#### Managing digital assets: explore new options or consolidate your platform?

**[TODO: A RACCOURCIR]**

We conceptualize the logic of digital business strategy in terms of two constructs: design capital (i.e., the cumulative stock of designs owned or controlled by a firm), and design moves (i.e., the discrete strategic actions that enlarge, reduce, or modify a firm's stock of designs). We also identify two salient dimensions of design capital, namely option value and technical debt [@Woodard2013].

Design capital as the cumulative stock of designs owned or controlled by a firm. Elements of a firm's design capital are typically designs for digital artifacts, such as software components and their associated interfaces and data structures, sometimes collectively called the firm's digital architecture. It enables the firm to innovate through new and improved designs [@Woodard2013].

Design moves are discrete strategic actions that enlarge, reduce, or modify a firm's stock of designs. For example, developing a new product or service, improving an existing component or reconfiguring the architecture itself [@Baldwin2004]. New designs are fundamentally options with associated economic option value. The option value of a design reflects both the value of the products or services in which it is directly realized and the value of the alternative designs that it makes possible. Option value is enhanced by architectures that enable designers to combine components within or across layers, cultivate or attract external partners (e.g., by providing application programming interfaces or software development kits), and launch innovative digital offerings [@Woodard2013].

Technical debt refers to the expected cost or effort entailed in exercising the options embedded in a firm's design capital. Technical debt is a natural by-product of the design process. Shortages of resources, time, or talent frequently lead designers intentionally to optimize for short-term goals at the expense of making a product or system easy to maintain and evolve. Like financial debt, sometimes technical debt can be necessary [@Woodard2013].
Option value and technical debt are akin to financial assets and liabilities, and define the net present value of a modular architecture as the difference between the two [@Woodard2013].

Resource munificence (or organizational slack available to designers) often proved to be an important contingency in every design capital state. Resource munificence explained why firms in the same state made moves that took them in different "directions" [@Woodard2013].

Disruptive innovation theory offers explanations for why companies succeed or fail to respond to disruptive innovations [@Karimi2015].
First-order dynamic capabilities that are created by changing, extending, or adapting a firm's existing resources, processes, and values are positively associated with building digital platform capabilities [@Karimi2015].
Managers [must] focus on the most promising factors for creating first-order dynamic capabilities [@Karimi2015].

Organizational ordinary capabilities are defined as "high-level routine" that confers a set of decision options for producing significant outputs of a particular type". They are the zero-level and "how we earn a living now" capabilities. A capability gap is the distance between a firm's existing configuration of capabilities and the most valuable configuration potentially available post the technological change [@Karimi2015].

Dynamic capabilities govern the rate of change in organizational ordinary capabilities and are essential in responding to disruptive technological shifts. Dynamic capabilities theory is an extension of the resource-based view of the firm. Dynamic capabilities are theorized as existing at different levels. The first-order dynamic capabilities "extend, modify, change and/or create ordinary capabilities". When deploying first-order dynamic capabilities may not be sufficient, a firm may need to develop second-order dynamic capabilities [@Daniel2014]. The second-order (or higher-order) dynamic capabilities enable spontaneous responsiveness in novel situations and in recessionary conditions [@Daniel2014].

Each of the four firms in our study gained significant advantages as the quality of their design capital improved. All four case firms were constrained by high debt or lack of options (or both) at various times during our observation period [@Woodard2013].

The role of design moves in our conceptual model is to provide a structured way of thinking about the actions taken by firms in pursuit of high-quality design capital [@Woodard2013].

Option-constrained Design Capital. Startup firms and new business units tend to possess option-constrained design capital. Such firms can make two distinct kinds of design moves: increase the option value of its designs, increase its technical debt. When resources are scarce, designers experience pressures to address urgent business needs without the necessary slack to lay a firm foundation for the future. This leads to an accumulation of technical debt. When firms have abundant resources, designers have the necessary slack to enact moves with a longer planning horizon, and often use this opportunity to create options that can be harvested in the future [@Woodard2013].

Proposition 1a: Under option-constrained design capital and resource scarcity, a firm's design moves will tend to increase the technical debt of its design capital [@Woodard2013].
Proposition 1b: Under option-constrained design capital and resource abundance, a firm's design moves will tend to create design options in its design capital [@Woodard2013].

Debt-constrained Design Capital. In a debt-constrained design capital state, a firm possesses high option value, but it is weighed down by high levels of technical debt. Under resource scarcity, investments in reducing technical debt through additional development efforts are unlikely to be feasible, but firms can also meet their short-term obligations by abandoning debt-laden modules and their associated design options. Debt-constrained firms that have access to abundant resources can afford to reduce their debt without abandoning options [@Woodard2013].

Proposition 2a: Under debt-constrained design capital and resource scarcity, a firm's design moves will tend to abandon design options [@Woodard2013].
Proposition 2b: Under debt-constrained design capital and resource abundance, a firm's design moves will tend to reduce its technical debt [@Woodard2013].

Low-quality Design Capital. It is a state in which a firm possesses few design options, and its ability to exercise the options it does possess is impeded by high technical debt. When designers face both low-quality design capital and a resource-scarce environment, their choice of design moves is over-constrained. It is unsustainable: either the product or project needs to be "bailed out" or higher management needs to "pull the plug" on it. In the absence of resource constraints, designers can exit a low-quality design capital state either by reducing debt or creating options [@Woodard2013].

Proposition 3a: Under low-quality design capital and resource abundance, a firm's design moves will tend to reduce technical debt if the technical capability of the firm is high [@Woodard2013].
Proposition 3b: Under low-quality design capital and resource abundance, a firm's design moves will tend to create design options if the technical capability of the firm is low [@Woodard2013].

High-quality Design Capital. High-quality design capital, a state with high option value and low technical debt, can confer unfettered competitive advantage. Differences in a firm's ability to transfer the costs of technical debt to other members of its ecosystem (including end users) provided a systematic explanation for the differing transitions [@Woodard2013].

Proposition 4a: Under high-quality design capital and resource scarcity, a firm's design moves will tend to increase technical debt if the firm's ability to transfer technical debt to other members of its ecosystem is high [@Woodard2013].
Proposition 4b: Under high-quality design capital and resource scarcity, a firm's design moves will tend to abandon design options if its ability to transfer technical debt to other members of its ecosystem is low [@Woodard2013].

Firms with high quality design capital tended to create product or service platforms that, in turn, enabled them to sustain a state of high-quality design capital. We observed two distinct kinds of platform strategies: one focused on internal economies of scale and scope, and the other focused on influencing an external ecosystem [@Woodard2013].

We developed a conceptual framework that emphasizes the strategic importance of the cumulative stock of designs owned or controlled by a firm (design capital), and the sequence of discrete strategic actions that increase, reduce, or modify a firm's design capital (design moves). We conceptualized design capital as a two-dimensional construct comprising option value and technical debt, and adopted the design move as a unit of analysis to explore the duality between design moves and design capital [@Woodard2013].

### Organize for Speed & Product Leadership

Our organizational structures have evolved to manage scarcity. The concept of ownership works well for scarcity, but accessing or sharing works better in an abundant, information-based world. While the information-based world is now moving exponentially, our organizational structures are still very linear (especially large ones). Matrix structures don't work in an exponential, information-based world. Rapid or disruptive change is something that large, matrixed organizations find extremely difficult [@VanGeest2014].

The paradigm is **not displacement and replacement**, but **connectivity and recombination**  [@Iansiti2014]

Speed of Digital Business Strategy: time takes on a more central role in digital business settings [@Bharadwaj2013].

#### Assets for product leadership: Infrastructure & Innovation culture

##### Infrastructure

**Products and content:** Product companies often find they can build new digital business around strong products. For example, a manufacturer of expensive long-lived transportation products is building services that digitally diagnose and help to maintain those devices [@Westerman2011].

**An hardware and software symbiose:** Infrastructure is to information as a bottle is to wine: the technology is the packaging that allows the information to be delivered to end consumers. A single copy of a film would be of little value without a distribution technology. Likewise, computer software is valuable only because computer hardware and network technology are now so powerful and inexpensive. The value of the Web lies in its capacity to provide immediate access to information. Using the Web, information suppliers can distribute up-to-date information dynamically from databases and other repositories [@Shapiro1999].

Improved information infrastructure has vastly increased our ability to store, retrieve, sort, filter, and distribute information, thereby greatly enhancing the value of the underlying information itself. Content providers cannot operate without infrastructure suppliers, and vice versa. The information economy is about both information and the associated technology [@Shapiro1999].

##### Innovation culture

**Product innovation:** Some firms use digital transformation to connect their engineers more closely with global manufacturers or uses digital technology to connect designers closer to manufacturers, speeding the design-to-market cycle time [@Westerman2011].

**Culture:** Some firms are able to use culture as a powerful asset. For some firms, entrepreneurial culture made digital transformation easier. Whereas unionized culture restricted change [@Westerman2011].

#### Experimentation: real-time data and high quality digital platform

Ongoing streams of performance data open up the possibility of conducting controlled experiments on new ideas. Digital leaders have pursued this kind of A/B testing for years on-line and other companies are experimenting in physical settings [@WESTERMAN2015].

**Experimentation:** Experimentation as the implementation of the lean Startup methodology of testing assumptions and constantly experimenting with controlled risks [@VanGeest2014].

Market risk: Will people buy the product? Starting in the 2000s, startups could test the market like never before by leveraging A/B testing, Google AdWords campaigns, social media and landing pages. Now an idea could be partially validated before product engineering even began [@VanGeest2014].

**Unencumbered development.** The innovators who create products at "hackathons" aren't even trying to disrupt your business. You're just the collateral damage. Bigbang innovations are often born of rapid-fire, low-cost experiments on fast-maturing, ubiquitous technology platforms. These innovations are often built out of readily available components that cost little or are free. In the future the most successful innovators may be those who simply happen upon the right combination of other people's technologies. These experiments take place directly in the market, using open platforms built on the internet, cloud computing, and fast-cycling mobile devices. In the bizarro world of big-bang disrupters, it is perfectly rational to churn out dozens of new products and see which ones take hold [@Downes2013].

It's easier to innovate and experiment with a high quality design platform:

If a firm is fortunate enough to be in a position of high-quality design capital and resource abundance, this describes an under-constrained situation for designers that favors experimentation and entrepreneurial actions. Such an environment requires effective sense-making and the ability to cope with complexity and uncertainty [@Woodard2013].

#### Embracing Disruption vs Fighting the environment with Regulation

Regulations are slowly adapting to evolutions in society.

**Lead your customers or follow them?** Incumbents too have opportunities for launching disruptive strategies. However, in some situations, the right decision may be to give up digital moves, particularly in industries with high barriers to entry, regulatory complexities, and patents that protect profit streams. Between these extremes lies the all-too-common reality that digital efforts risk cannibalizing products and services and could erode margins. Yet inaction is equally risky. In-house data on existing buyers can help incumbents with large customer bases develop insights. Brand advantages too can help traditional players outflank digital newbies [@Hirt2014].

**Disrupt yourself:** With enterprising entrepreneurs and enthusiastic hackers determined to change the status quo, disruption is now a constant state of business. A commitment to constantly increasing customer value (not just profits) can help preempt disruption from external sources. A willingness to engage in creative destruction of the current business model will prevent enterprises from suffering the innovator's dilemma that allows others to sneak up and disrupt their business. Industry incumbents are not all standing on the sidelines watching newcomers define the future of their industries [@Gimpel2012].

**Join them to beat them:** Trying to regulate away disruption is often ineffective. Embracing a disruption can create new opportunities. Making content more widely available might cannibalize some traditional TV revenue, but it allows broadcasters to retain the Millennial generation. The future is here. You cannot fight it [@Gimpel2012].

**Regulation and reputation:** Executives might be careful about mobile and social technologies because of security and privacy concerns. Some firms have concern over regulatory impacts on their potential digital initiatives. And a hacked access to confidential data has reputational repercussions well beyond any regulatory penalties. Some firms take a slow approach to social media for fear of regulatory sanction. While these regulatory concerns are real, they need not prevent companies from moving forward.  [@Westerman2011]

**Managing Intellectual Property**

If the creators of an information good can reproduce it cheaply, others can copy it cheaply. It has long been recognized that some form of "privatization" of information helps to ensure its production. But the legal grant of exclusive rights to intellectual property via patents, copyright, and trademarks does not confer complete power to control information. Digital information can be perfectly copied and instantaneously transmitted around the world, leading many content producers to view the Internet as one giant, out-of-control copying machine [@Shapiro1999].

Despite this danger, we think that content owners tend to be too conservative with respect to the management of their intellectual property. The history of the video industry is a good example. Hollywood was petrified by the advent of videotape recorders. Ironically, Hollywood now makes more from video than from theater presentations for most productions. The video sales and rental market, once so feared, has become a giant revenue source for Hollywood [@Shapiro1999].

When managing intellectual property, your goal should be to choose the terms and conditions that maximize the value of your intellectual property, not the terms and conditions that maximize the protection [@Shapiro1999].

#### IT Renting & Staff on-demand increases Up-Down Scaling speed

Speed of Product Launches: when traditional firms add digital dimensions to their business strategy, the clock speed of product launches is recalibrated by the speed set by the pure-play companies. Managers across a variety of industries find themselves with capabilities that are misaligned with those of their new competitors. As we combine Moore’s Law with steady increases in band-width speed and mobile technologies, speed of product launches with connectivity to cloud becomes critical and important. And also, planned obsolescence becomes fundamental to a firm’s competitive success and survival under digital business conditions. Lastly, with increased digitization, product launches need to be coordinated in networks with complementary products and services [@Bharadwaj2013].

Rapid Digital Scale Up/Down as Strategic Dynamic Capability: When the digital infrastructure and business strategy are fused, this rapid scaling ability becomes a strategic dynamic capability for the firm to adapt to the dynamic requirements of the digital marketplace [@Bharadwaj2013].

**Leveraged Assets:** Recently there's been an accelerating trend towards outsourcing even mission-critical assets. ExOs retain their flexibility precisely by not owning assets, even in strategic areas. This practice optimizes flexibility and allows the enterprise to scale incredibly quickly. Non-ownership, then, is the key to owning the future, except, of course, when it comes to scarce resources and assets. For example, Tesla owns its own factories and Amazon its own warehouses. When the asset in question is rare or extremely scarce, then ownership is a better option. But if your asset is information-based or commoditized at all, then accessing is better than possessing [@VanGeest2014].

Scale Through Alliances and Partnerships through shared digital assets. Firms modularize their business processes and rely on plug-and-play capabilities for richly linking digital assets and rely on linkages through application programming interfaces (APIs) and web services [@Bharadwaj2013].

**Rent, Don't Own:** An important mechanism empowering individuals and small teams everywhere is
low-cost access to technology and tools. Cloud computing, which offers the ability to store and manage massive amounts of information with unlimited processing, all on a cost-per-use basis requiring no upfront costs or capital investments. This makes memory almost free. The cloud also puts small companies on the same footing as, or even gives them an advantage over, big companies, which are burdened by expensive internal IT. This rent-not-own philosophy further extends the current craze of collaborative consumption and the sharing economy. Why not rent those assets, reducing up-front investment and leaving the ownership and maintenance of state-of-the-art facilities to someone else? Be it facilities, equipment, computing or people, the concept of renting rather than owning is a major factor contributing to an ExO's agility and flexibility [@VanGeest2014].

#### Small & independent units

**Smaller Beats Bigger:** Scale and size have been desirable traits in an enterprise. The conventional wisdom says that a bigger company could leverage economies of scale and negotiate from strength. All that is changing. The unparalleled and unprecedented ability of a small team
today to do big things if the exponential technologies described previously are put to use. Both now and in the coming years, adaptability and agility will increasingly eclipse size and scale. A small team can take on much bigger risks than a large one [@VanGeest2014].

Dedicated financial resources (DFR): Dedicating these resources to responding to digital disruption can facilitate new growth by avoiding the traps associated with allocating all slack resources to core products and by removing the obstacles that would otherwise limit the potential for innovative ideas to succeed [9, 63] [@Karimi2015].

Dedicated human resources (DHR): Relying just on human resources already allocated to the core products can sharply limit a newspaper company's ability to sell innovative non-core products and to capture new business models [@Karimi2015].

Autonomous growth group (AGG): It is essential for creating new processes or ways of working together because individuals of those groups or teams often do not represent their functional group interests. It is a necessary condition when a new venture needs to take an approach that the old venture dislikes or rejects, or when a new venture needs to create new growth that may disrupt the core business. Otherwise, chances are that either a low priority is assigned to new ideas or an old business model may be force-fitted onto the new opportunity [@Karimi2015].

Staged allocation of resources (SAR): It can force innovation teams to zero in quickly on critical assumptions, find cheap ways to test those assumptions, and develop lean and flexible structures for innovation projects. Instead of risking big investments on uncertain strategies, newspaper companies can "invest a little to learn a lot" about the key uncertainties in their approach, reduce the cost and risk of innovation, and encourage smart experiments and risk-mitigation strategies [@Karimi2015].

Staged allocation of funding resources allows for committing small amounts of resources to multiple innovation projects establishing an autonomous growth group, business unit, or "heavyweight" development team is essential for creating new processes or ways of working together because individuals of those groups or teams often do not represent their functional group interests [@Karimi2015].

### Organize for Customization & Customer Intimacy

#### Assets for customer intimacy: Sales infrastructure, Brand, Customer knowledge

##### Sales force

**Sales force:** source of customer loyalty is the set of relationships cultivated by a strong sales force. Digital initiatives can threaten to disintermediate salespeople. However, digital transformation can also be used to enhance those relationships [@Westerman2011].

**Point of sale and distribution channels:** Stores are often a strong source of location-based advantage, even in a digital world [@Westerman2011].

**Customer touch points:** Fast and transparent problem resolution builds trust for customers (for example, through a twitter account to answer client complaints). Companies with multiple channels to the customer are experiencing pressure to provide an integrated experience. Some firms are moving beyond simple multi-channel models to enable new forms of digital strategy: they supplements the multichannel experience through a new type of storefront. Several companies are offering self-service via digital tools. These tools allow the customer to save time, while saving the company money [@Westerman2011].

But beware of assumptions: **Our customers really value the human touch.** Not all interactions with humans are actually valuable to customers. Digital innovation can combine no-touch (or limited-touch) service with high customer satisfaction. However, transitioning to a direct-to-consumer model can be difficult: agents or dealers can rebel against what they perceive as a threat to their commissions. But, digital self-service environments can enhance the customer experience and also gather a rich stream of behavioral data that can help boost customer satisfaction and revenues [@WESTERMAN2015].

Other firms are using concept stores as flagships for their digital selling innovations [@Westerman2011].

##### Brand to become the standard

**Brand:** Companies with a strong brand are able to leverage it in related offerings. Through mobile web, social media and other digital initiatives, building additional points of contact with customers [@Westerman2011].

In competing to become the standard, or at least to achieve critical mass, consumer expectations are critical. In a very real sense, the product that is expected to become the standard will become the standard. Self-fulfilling expectations are one manifestation of positive-feedback economics and 'bandwagon effects. As a result, companies participating in markets with strong network effects seek to convince customers that their products will ultimately become the standard, while rival, incompatible products will soon be orphaned [@Shapiro1999].

##### Customer Knowledge

Newspaper companies often have extensive local data about institutions, businesses, and local residents. Newspaper companies could develop a range of digital non-core products such as on-line marketing solutions [@Karimi2015].

**Customer knowledge:** Companies have gathered more and more knowledge about customers. They can start envisioning the next step, monetizing this relationship to launch new products, enhance customer relationships or augment sales via customer-segmentation [@Westerman2011].

**Customer understanding:** Firms are exploring social media to understand customer satisfiers and dissatisfiers. Companies are learning to promote their brands more effectively through digital media: social media campaign, educational digital tools, building new on-line communities. Firms are building analytics capability to understand customers and actively conducting experiments in pricing and promotion [@Westerman2011].

PagesJaunes, the French Yellow Pages company, saw that the assets related to printing and delivering books would have little use in the new model, but the company's knowledge of local businesses and the relationships its salespeople had with business owners were potentially critical assets going forward. By leveraging existing data and retraining the sales force, the company is attempting to reinvent itself in partnership with former competitor Google Inc. PagesJaunes began ramping up digital revenues in France faster than physical revenues were declining [@WESTERMAN2015].

#### Value-based pricing

Sellers can adjust product bundling and pricing depending on circumstances. Technology are also changing the economics of manufacturing and making custom manufacturing more efficient [@WESTERMAN2015].

**Value-based & differential pricing (instead of marginal-cost-based pricing):** Price on value, not on marginal cost: Cost-based pricing just doesn't work: a 10 or 20 percent markup on unit cost makes no sense when unit cost is zero. You must price your information goods according to consumer value, not according to your production cost [@Shapiro1999]. Since people have widely different values for a particular piece of information, value-based pricing leads naturally to differential pricing [@Shapiro1999].

**Top-line growth:** Companies are using technology to enhance in-person sales conversations. Using tablet-based presentations and introducing mobile tools to help sales people and customers engage in analytics-based planning. Analytics help to segment clients [@Westerman2011].

Learning to sell the new model

- It requires an approach that integrates with the client's proprietary **financial and operational data** and an extensive familiarity with the client's balance sheet, financial strategies and approach to the market [@Iansiti2014].
- "Our sales team has to do a whole range of new spreadsheet calculations and modeling before we even approach a potential customer." [@Iansiti2014]

#### Experience goods selling: Let the customer have a taste  

**Experience goods, balancing giving it to let the customer enjoy it vs selling it:** Economists say that a good is an experience good if consumers must experience it to value it. Virtually any new product is an experience good, But information is an experience good every time it's consumed. Information businesses have devised various strategies to get wary consumers to overcome their reluctance to purchase information before they know what they are getting:

- First, there are various forms of browsing: you can look at the headlines of newspapers and watch previews of movies [@Shapiro1999].
- But ultimately, most media producers overcome the experience good problem through branding and reputation [@Shapiro1999].

The tension between giving away your information, to let people know what you have to offer, and charging them for it to recover your costs is a fundamental problem in the information economy [@Shapiro1999].

#### Customer Loyalty & Lock-in by manage the switching costs

Redefine customer engagement. Harness the data to fine-tune customer engagement. Design is also playing a more central role. Many companies are forced to sell their products or services in someone else’s ecosystem, which calls for careful strategies around pricing, value retention, and brand integrity [@Manyika2015].

**Switching costs (or transferring technical debt):** Sony and Philips had to deal with considerable consumer switching costs when introducing their CD technology. Fortunately for Sony and Philips, CDs offered significant improvement in convenience, durability, and sound quality over LPs, so consumers were willing to replace their music libraries. Switching costs are significant, and corporate information officers (CIOs) think long and hard about changing systems. Lock-in to historical, legacy systems is commonplace in the network economy. Such lock-in is not absolute, new technologies do displace old ones, but switching costs can dramatically alter firms' strategies and options. In fact, the magnitude of switching costs is itself a strategic choice made by the producer of the system [@Shapiro1999].

Lock-in arises whenever users invest in multiple complementary and durable assets specific to a particular information technology system. More generally, in replacing an old system with a new, incompatible one, you may find it necessary to swap out or duplicate all the components of your system. Switching from Apple to Intel equipment involves not only new hardware but new software. And not only that, the "wetware", the knowledge that you and your employees have built up that enables you to use your hardware and software, has to be updated. This type of situation is the norm in the information economy [@Shapiro1999].

Lock-in can occur on an individual level, a company level, or even a societal level [@Shapiro1999].

#### Business-model shift: Evolve your value proposition: from product to service to partnership

**Everything is Measurable and Anything is Knowable:** The sensor revolution is one of the most important and least celebrated technological revolutions taking place today. ExOs take advantage of this accelerating trend in two ways: by creating new business models on existing data streams or by adding new data streams to old paradigms. We are moving toward a world in which everything will be measured and anything can be knowable, both in the world around us and within our bodies. Plan for this to have a chance at long-term success [@VanGeest2014].

Sources of Value Creation and Capture: Digital business strategy brings in additional dimensions that alter the nature of value creation and capture [@Bharadwaj2013].

(1) first-order dynamic capabilities have a direct association with building digital platform capabilities and with newspaper companies' response to digital disruption in terms of revenue generated from all on-line sources [@Karimi2015]
(2) digital platform capabilities mediate the relationship between first-order dynamic capabilities and newspaper companies' response performance in terms of number of non-core products [@Karimi2015].

**Digitally-modified businesses:** Some firms are finding ways to augment physical with digital offerings. Other firms are staying true to their traditional business, but using digital to transform a new growth business through e-commerce platforms. Other firms are building digital or service wrappers around traditional products [@Westerman2011].

**New digital businesses:** Introducing digital products that complement traditional products or changing business models by reshaping their boundaries through digital [@Westerman2011].

**Diversify or double down on digital initiatives?** Diversification reduces risks, so many companies are tempted to let a thousand flowers bloom. Think like a private-equity fund, seeding multiple initiatives but being disciplined enough to kill off those that don't quickly gain momentum and to bankroll those with genuinely disruptive potential. The alternative is to double down in one area, which may be the right strategy in industries with massive value at stake [@Hirt2014].

Today, many companies are having new competitors, shifting the customer value proposition away from acquiring reliable industrial equipment to deriving new efficiencies and other benefits through advanced analytics and algorithms based on the data generated by that equipment [@Iansiti2014].

Now, GE's revenue from its jet engines is tied not to a simple sales transaction but to performance improvements: less downtime and more miles flown.  [@Iansiti2014]

Many software companies (and not only) have started to transform their business model:  [@Iansiti2014]

- switching from product to service revenue
- experimenting with outcomes-based business models in cases where revenue might be tied to the efficiencies delivered by an enterprise application

GE **sells less** hardware but has developed **mutually profitable partnerships**.  [@Iansiti2014]

GE's transformations:  [@Iansiti2014]

- **transactional**: break/fix. **Sell** parts & repair.
- **contractual**: service agreement. **Share risk**, reducing the total cost of ownership.
- **expanded customer outcomes**: optimized assets & operations. Use data & analytics to **provide decision support** services.

The focus of value creation shifts from value chain to value networks [@Karimi2015].

Build new assets and revenue streams. Digital disruptors have often destroyed more value than they have created for themselves, giving many of the benefits away to consumers. Businesses need to build a strong digital balance sheet. businesses that rely too heavily on a single revenue stream or on playing an intermediary role in a given market are particularly vulnerable [@Manyika2015].

#### Platforms: the Search / Broker business

Shifting to a Search / Broker Business by building a platform could be seen as a Customer Intimacy strategy: you can exploit an existing distribution network to help it and you are so much tailoring your offering to customers needs that you are offering your competitors products as well. Now the main actor to tailor the offering is not talented salesman but the search and recommendation algorithms. Amazon is an example: most clients go to this platform even if the number of products sold is tremendous: they know they will find something which suits their needs through the search and recommendations. Without those algorithms, Amazon would be efficient only on the Operational Excellence dimension, because the customer experience on the site would be fairly complex and much closer to wrangling through a storehouse than to going to a tailor.

**Attention is targetted: From broadcast to one-to-one marketing:** Selling viewers' attention has always been an attractive way to support information provision. The Internet, a hybrid between a broadcast medium and a point-to-point medium, offers exciting new potentials for matching up customers and suppliers. The Net allows information vendors to move from the conventional broadcast form of advertising to one-to-one marketing. This new, one-to-one marketing benefits both parties in the transaction: the advertiser reaches exactly the market it wants to target, and consumers need give their attention only to ads that are likely to be of interest. Furthermore, by gathering better information about what particular customers want, the information provider can design products that are more highly customized and hence more valuable [@Shapiro1999].

The use of digital platforms enables firms to break traditional industry boundaries and to operate in new spaces and niches [@Bharadwaj2013].

Platforms to connect to consumers: to reach new audiences through building digital community. Platforms that allow virtual communities to self-form. Platforms to connect to businesses [@Karimi2015].

Platforms are the future systems of engagement: A platform is a foundational technology or service that is used beyond a single firm and is subject to network effects. Platforms provide connectivity, expand variety, match different users with each other (i.e., suppliers and consumers), and set prices within the market [@Gimpel2012].

Executives must shift from thinking about value chains to value networks [@Gimpel2012].

Subject to network effects, size is important for platforms. But scale is not the only deciding factor: VRIN resources will still determine competitive advantage and will drive users toward one network rather than another. If a firm does not have a VRIN role for production, search, or delivery within the platform ecosystem, it will not have a sustainable competitive advantage. And if the platform ecosystem itself is not VRIN, then another platform will dominate [@Gimpel2012]. (Note: here in this citation, VRIN is synonym of Value)

Digital platforms will become the gateways (and bottlenecks) to the market [@Gimpel2012].

Value Creation from Multisided Business Models: multisided revenue models are important not just in software. New leaders in the digital space base their _raison d’être_ on such models, which can be also multilayered by giving away certain products or services in one layer to capture value at a different layer. More nuanced ways to conceptualize the drivers of value creation and capture arise by thinking about the multisided nature of interactions [@Bharadwaj2013].

### Organize for Optimization & Operational Excellence

#### Valuable assets

**Partnership network:** Trusted relationships can deliver powerful new operating models. A firm is switching from a single value chain link to a value chain orchestrator. Partners cooperated in the project because of years of working together [@Westerman2011].

#### Employee augmentation

Beware of the assumption:
**We've reached the limit of how far we can automate our operational processes.** In the past, automation worked best for standardized repetitive tasks. It also allows you to radically redesign the way your company operates. Beyond just replacing workers, new technologies can augment their activities or free them to do more fulfilling work [@WESTERMAN2015].

**What Types of Operational Changes Do You Expect?** New technologies can significantly change the current products and services delivered to customers. Digital technologies can enable changes to business processes. Business processes can be classified as operational, support and management, but the typical focus of digital transformation initiatives is on operational processes. A company must define their processes and assess which of them will be affected by digital transformation [@Hess2016].

**Process digitization:** Companies historically have used automation to make processes more efficient and scalable. Automation can enable companies to refocus their people on more strategic tasks. ERP for example centralize the HR function, allowing economies of scale through self-service while freeing HR people. It also creates streams of data that can be useful in later data mining efforts. New technologies are extending this trend of gaining benefits beyond efficiency: automated plants reduce labor requirements, improve product quality and enhance environmental, health, and safety performance. Going digital can also help reducing the product development lifecycle [@Westerman2011].

**Interfaces:** Interfaces are filtering and matching processes by which ExOs bridge from SCALE externalities to internal IDEAS control frameworks. They are algorithms and automated workflows that route the output of SCALE externalities to the right people at the right time internally.  These processes start out manual and gradually become automated around the edges. These Interface processes are unique and proprietary to the organization that developed them, and as such comprise a unique type of intellectual property. ExOs invest considerable attention to Interfaces and a great deal of human-centered design thinking is brought to optimize every instantiation. Interfaces manage abundance. While most processes are optimized around scarcity and efficiency, SCALE elements generate large result sets, meaning Interfaces are geared towards filtering and matching [@VanGeest2014].

#### Measuring everything

With exponential output, the internal organization needs to be extremely robust, precise and properly tuned to process all the inputs. Those are distinctly different internal operations that encompass everything from their business philosophies to how employees interact with one another, how they measure their performance (and what they value in that performance), and even their attitudes toward risk. In fact, especially their attitudes toward risk [@VanGeest2014].

**Dashboards:** Given the huge amounts of data from customers and employees becoming available, ExOs need a new way to measure and manage the organization: a real-time, adaptable dashboard with all essential company and employee metrics, accessible to everyone in the organization. Many ExOs are adopting the Objectives and Key Results (OKR) method. OKRs are the answer to two simple questions: Where do I want to go? (Objectives) How will I know I'm getting there? (Key Results to ensure progress is made). KPIs are determined top-down, while OKRs are determined bottom-up. Objectives are qualitative and Key Results are quantitative. OKRs are about the company's goals and how each employee contributes to those goals. Performance evaluations, which are entirely about evaluating how an employee performed in a given period, are independent of OKRs. Objectives are ambitious and should feel uncomfortable. Dashboards of value metrics, used in conjunction with OKRs, are becoming the de facto standard for measuring ExOs Dashboards are key for ExOs because growing at a rapid pace requires that instrumentation of the business, individual and team assessments be integrated and carried out in real time [@VanGeest2014].

**Monitoring progress through KPIs:** Leaders need to ensure that a transparent set of metrics and KPIs are in place to constantly monitor and review progress towards that ambition. We monitor our progress through a transparent scorecard where everyone can see a quantified assessment of our progress and take actions against it [@Westerman2011].

#### Business virtualization and Staff on demand

The Speed of Supply Chain Orchestration: End-to-end visibility and ERP deployments have allowed companies to be more efficient. And, coupled with outsourcing of non-core activities to a network of partners, this has allowed companies to optimize their supply chains. In industries marked by fast changes in technology functionality, competitive advantage lies not in just announcing new products (first-mover advantage) but in ensuring the availability of new products on a global basis to capture the fast-mover advantage [@Bharadwaj2013].

**Staff on Demand:** In any information-enabled business a large internal staff seems increasingly unnecessary, counterproductive and expensive [@VanGeest2014].

Business virtualization: firms can reduce costs, increase agility, and boost quality by partnering with outside firms [@Gimpel2012].

**Plug-and-play business models** As digital forces reduce transaction costs, value chains disaggregate. Amazon, for instance, offers businesses logistics, on-line retail "storefronts," and IT services [@Hirt2014].

#### Ecosystem & partnering beyond Supply chain management

The company that best understands information systems and complementary products will be best positioned to move rapidly and aggressively [@Shapiro1999].

Because of the importance of critical mass, because customer expectations are so important in the area of information infrastructure, and because technology is evolving so rapidly, the timing of strategic moves is even more important in the information industry than in others. Moving too early means making compromises in technology and going out on a limb without sufficient allies. Whether you are trying to establish a new information technology or to extend the lifetime of technology that is already popular, you will face critical compatibility decisions [@Shapiro1999].

Another method for achieving critical mass is to assemble a powerful group of strategic partners. For this purpose, partners can be customers, complementers, or even competitors. If you own valuable intellectual property but need to gain critical mass, you must decide whether to promote your technology unilaterally, in the hope that it will become a de facto standard that you can tightly control, or to take various "openness" commitments to help achieve a critical mass [@Shapiro1999].

Digital Business Strategy Extends the Scope Beyond Firm Boundaries and Supply Chains to Dynamic Ecosystems That Cross Traditional Industry Boundaries [@Bharadwaj2013].

Business ecosystems that are intricately intertwined such that digital business strategy cannot be conceived independently of the business ecosystem, alliances, partnerships, and competitors [@Bharadwaj2013].

Rather than thinking of scale only in terms of physical factors of production, supply chains, or geographic coverage, we need to think of scale in both physical and digital terms [@Bharadwaj2013].

Value Capture through Coordinated Business Models in Networks: value creation and capture in digital settings often involve complex and dynamic coordination across multiple companies. Business models are not inde-pendent but intersect and interoperate across these different players [@Bharadwaj2013].

**Cooperate or compete with new attackers?** A large incumbent in an industry that's undergoing digital disruption can feel like a whale attacked by piranhas. It's not feasible to defend all fronts simultaneously, so cooperation with some attackers can make more sense than competing. Like, for exemple, opening software interfaces to multiple third parties [@Hirt2014].

_"Starting from the idea of asset optimization and no unplanned downtime... the maximum customer **value is in the ecosystem**. How **open** do we want this to be ?"_ [@Iansiti2014]

To build its ecosystem: GE is experimenting with different types of partnerships, like joint-ventures. GE has also partnered with potential competitors (like Intel, Cisco, Accenture, Amazon web services) [@Iansiti2014]

Speed of Network Formation and Adaptation: The pace of network formation is rapidly accelerating in every firm. One of the key requirements of digital business strategy is new organizational capability to design, structure, and manage networks that provide complementary capabilities to what firms have inside their own hierarchies. Like app developers which align and realign their affinity to the different platforms based on technical functionality and attractiveness [@Bharadwaj2013].

The ability to transfer technical debt emerged in our analysis as an important contingency. We observed that firms could sometimes shift the burden of their technical debt to their customers. For example, customers who are faced with high switching costs may be forced to bear the costs of incompatibility between releases of a vendor's product [@Woodard2013].

### To rework

##### IT centralization & Employee decentralization: think global, act local  

Beware of the assumption:
**Working as an integrated company will slow us down and stifle innovation.** Pre-digital wisdom held that centralized companies, while slower to innovate, can be more efficient [and] argued that decentralized companies can be more responsive to local markets. This kind of mind-set forced managers to choose between two suboptimal structures. One of the paradoxes of digital technology is that standardization can actually lead to increased agility. Smart mobile devices, collaboration platforms and big data analytics wire organizations differently. Decentralized companies can have integration where it counts. Integrated systems and centralized processes offer benefits that go beyond efficiency and quality improvement and can also be useful platforms for innovation [@WESTERMAN2015].

**Digital globalization:** Transforming from multi-national to truly global operations with integrated information to gain global synergies while remaining locally responsive. "Becoming more centralized and decentralized at the same time." Global shared services promote efficiency and global flexibility. It requires a different approach to policy: "fewer mandates from headquarters, but more guidelines." [@Westerman2011]

**Culture issues:** On another level, previously autonomous country managers require coaching to grow comfortable working in an environment of centralized shared services and standardized processes [@Westerman2011].
