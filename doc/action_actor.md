#### Information properties

We use the term information very broadly. Essentially, anything that can be digitized, encoded as a stream of bits, is information. Regardless of the particular source of value, people are willing to pay for information. As we see, many strategies for purveyors of information are based on the fact that consumers differ greatly in how they value particular information goods [@Shapiro1999].

Information has 3 fundamental properties: [@Iansiti2014]

- Information can be transmitted perfectly without error: no depreciation with time/usage
- Information can be replicated indefinitely: no reproduction cost
- Information can be communicated to the incremental consumer at zero marginal cost: no transport cost

Along the report we use interchangeably _Data_, _Information_ and sometimes _Insights_ or _Knowledge_. All those terms refers to the same concept of Information we described above.

#### Ubiquity of Information technology

As seen in the introduction, [each technological revolution has its key factor](#technological-revolution) has its key factor and the key factor of the current Information & telecommunications revolution is cheap electronic chips. In each case, the "key factor" steers engineering and investment decisions towards its intensive use. New technology systems are built accordingly, based on: microelectronics, software & telecommunications [@Perez2004].

The post-dotcom decade has seen firms, both established and startups, taking advantage of lower price/performance levels of computing (hardware and software) as well as global connectivity through standard protocols (e.g., Internet and mobile web) [@Bharadwaj2013]. Today the focus is on connectivity, platforms, data, and software. These spread faster than classic computing hardware due to their network effects and the marginal cost economics associated with it [@Manyika2015]. Information goods, powerful computing devices, and inexpensive digital communication are changing business and society [@Gimpel2012].

#### Exponential growth of Information technology

Futurist Ray Kurzweil made 4 signature observations about the evolution of Information technology [@VanGeest2014]:

1. First, the doubling pattern identified by Gordon Moore in integrated circuits applies to any information technology. Kurzweil calls this the Law of Accelerating Returns (LOAR) and shows that doubling patterns in computation extend all the way back to 1900, far earlier than Moore's original pronouncement.
2. Second, the driver fueling this phenomenon is information. Once any domain, discipline, technology or industry becomes information-enabled and powered by information flows, its price/performance begins doubling approximately annually.
3. Third, once that doubling pattern starts, it doesn't stop.
4. Finally, several key technologies today are now information-enabled and following the same trajectory. Those technologies include artificial intelligence (AI), robotics, biotech and bioinformatics, medicine, neuroscience, data science, 3D printing, nanotechnology and even aspects of energy.

The explosive transition from film to digital photography is now occurring in several accelerating technologies. We are information-enabling everything. An information-enabled environment delivers fundamentally disruptive opportunities. E.g: the cheapest 3D printers now cost only \$ 100, which means that within five years or so most of us will be able to afford 3D printers to fabricate toys, cutlery, tools and fittings. Essentially anything we're able to dream up [@VanGeest2014].

#### Exponential growth of Information: the rise of "Big data"

The digital universe is made up of images and videos on mobile phones uploaded to YouTube, digital movies populating the pixels of our high-definition TVs, banking data swiped in an ATM, security footage at airports and major events such as the Olympic Games, subatomic collisions recorded by the Large Hadron Collider at CERN, transponders recording highway tolls, voice calls zipping through digital phone lines, and texting as a widespread means of communications [@Gantz2012].

In the past we have operated under conditions of data (information) scarcity with decisions made with incomplete and often poor quality (even time-lapsed) data, big data create conditions of data (information) abundance due to the massive amount of detailed (and often ready to analyze) data made available [@Bharadwaj2013].

From 2005 to 2020, the digital universe will grow by a factor of 300, from 130 exabytes to 40,000 exabytes, or 40 trillion gigabytes (more than 5,200 gigabytes for every man, woman, and child in 2020). From now until 2020, the digital universe will double about every two years [@Gantz2012].

Examples of currently exploding (and potentially valuable) data sources [@Gantz2012]:

- Surveillance footage: as IP cameras continue to proliferate, footage can be captured, analyzed, and tagged in real time. This type of tagging can expedite crime investigations, enhance retail analytics for consumer traffic patterns, and, of course, improve military intelligence.
- Embedded and medical devices: In the future, sensors of all types (including those that may be implanted into the body) will capture vital and nonvital biometrics, all in real time.
- Entertainment and social media: Trends based on crowds can help pick winners and losers in the stock market, and even predict the outcome of elections.
- Consumer images: We say a lot about ourselves when we post pictures of ourselves or our families or friends.
- Transactions: in addition, of course, to the normal transactional data running through enterprise computers in the course of normal data processing today.

#### Physical capabilities of Information technology: Automation / Robotics / 3D printing & Additive manufacturing

New technologies such as robotics, 3-D printing, augmented reality and the "Internet of Things" will soon lead to major business changes [@WESTERMAN2015].

Digitization has contributed to increasingly jobless recoveries from recessions. The postwar US economy took roughly six months to recover lost jobs after every recession. But it took 15 months to restore lost jobs after the 1991 recession, 39 months after 2001, and 43 months after 2008 [@Manyika2015].

Digitization has contributed to hollowing out the middle-skill portion of the US workforce. Since 2000, the US has created 8 million jobs : only low-skill interactive jobs or high-skill interactive jobs. Whereas, 2.5 million production and transaction jobs have been destroyed [@Manyika2015].

In terms of wages, digitization has accelerated a divergence between the majority of workers and a smaller group at the top. And, since 1980, labor productivity has grown 2.5 times faster than wages, breaking historical patterns [@Manyika2015].

#### Cognitive capabilities of Information technology: Analytics / AI & Deep learning

During the last 2 decades, we already witnessed that specific computer algorithms could beat the human world champions at games, which are specific controlled environments:

- Gerald Tesauro's TD-Gammon has beaten Backgammon Champions in 1992 [@Tesauro1995]
- IBM's Deep Blue has beaten Chess Champion Gary Kasparov in 1997 [@Campbell2002]
- IBM's Watson has beaten Jeopardy (a TV Question-Answering contest) Champions in 2011 [@Ferrucci2013]
- Deepmind's AlphaGo has beaten Go champion Lee Sedol in 2016 [@Hassabis2016]

In less controlled environmentDeep learning is getting good results in more and more scientific fields: Character Recognition in the early 90s, Speech Recognition in the 2010s, Computer Vision in 2014 and now Natural Language Processing (see Yann Lecun's [post on facebook](https://www.facebook.com/yann.lecun/posts/10154498539442143)). Those results are deemed good becase those algorithms are much faster and on par with humans' accuracy on those increasingly complex tasks:

- Character Recognition AI is now widely used to process automatically many types of documents (invoices, purchase orders) and in postal sorting offices to read hand-written adresses [@Marinai2005].
- Speech Recognition AI is now used to power phone-answering-robots in call centers and in search engine applications on smartphones.
- Computer Vision AI is used by Facebook to recognize faces [@Taigman2014] and has been used in medical image analysis for decades [@DeBruijne2016].
- Natural Language Processing AI is used by Google to improve its Google Translate tool [@Castelvecchi2016].     

The booming growth of machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI), like most transformational technologies, is both exciting and scary, considering the social and personal implications, and particularly the implications for our careers. As AI improves, which is happening quickly, a much broader set of "thinking" rather than "doing" jobs will be aﬀected. Jobs, that, until the last few years, we couldn't imagine being done without the participation of an actual, trained human being [@Beck2017]. Some 60 percent of occupations could have 30 percent or more of their activities automated. Workers of all skill levels, including highly skilled professionals, will not be immune [@Manyika2015]. The Idea that technological advances favor more skilled workers is a twentieth century phenomenon [@Acemoglu2002]. It's long been known that AI and automation/robotics will change markets and workforces. We all need to develop new skills in order to diﬀerentiate ourselves [@Beck2017].

Many skilled jobs are cognitive jobs (like Doctors, Financial advisers, Business consultants) and follow the same Information-based workflow: [@Beck2017]

1. Gather data
2. Analyze the data
3. Interpret the results
4. Determine a recommended course of action
5. Implement the course of action

Highly skilled workers can command high rates because of three capabilities. Their abilities to go through the early rote tasks quickly and accurately; their experiences and judgment in determining a course of action; and their savviness for helping clients navigate that course. AI and machine learning will quickly surpass our abilities on the first two capabilities. It’s easy to see the role of automated systems in data gathering and analysis, we’ve accepted that machines can do these types of tasks efficiently. However, their potential goes much further [@Beck2017].

Software replaces labor in digital businesses. Computers increasingly are performing complex tasks. Even knowledge-intensive areas, such as oncology diagnostics, are susceptible to challenge by machines [@Hirt2014]. Middle-skill occupations such as clerical, sales, production, and operational roles will be highly impacted. Automation could displace from 10 to 15 percent of these jobs in the decade ahead, which would represent a sharp acceleration of historical displacement rates [@Manyika2015]. Digitization will encroach on a growing number of knowledge roles within companies as they automate many front-line and middle-management jobs based upon synthesizing information for C-level executives [@Hirt2014].

Technology is beginning to encroach on human skills. There is growing anxiety about job losses, but IT technology creates the need for new roles [@Manyika2015]. Those that want to stay relevant in their professions will need to focus on skills and capabilities that artificial intelligence has trouble replicating - understanding, motivating, and interacting with human beings. These human capabilities that will become more and more prized over the next decade. Skills like persuasion, social understanding, and empathy are going to become diﬀerentiators as artificial intelligence and machine learning take over our other tasks. Unfortunately, these human-oriented skills have generally been viewed as second priority in terms of training and education [@Beck2017].

According to @Frey2017, 3 Tasks categories won't be automated: [@Frey2017]

- **Perception & Manipulation** tasks: especially in unstructured work environment (personal house vs airport or train station), irregular objects.
- **Creative Intelligence** tasks: it's making unfamiliar combinations for familiar ideas and find which ones make sense. E.g: jokes. Value of creativity is inherently subjective, so evaluation of a robot on creative Intelligence tasks is difficult.
- **Social intelligence** tasks: involving negotiation, persuasion and care.

### Humans

#### Increasing speed of adoption of technologies: the birth of Homo Numericus

Many people suggest that rates of new product introduction and adoption are speeding up since centuries. It seems to be true: It took decades for the telephone to reach 50% of households, beginning before 1900, whereas it took five years or less for cellphones to accomplish the same penetration in 1990. And innovations introduced more recently are being adopted more quickly [@McGrath2013].

It took 30 years for electricity and 25 years for telephones to reach 10% adoption but less than five years for tablet devices to achieve the 10% rate. It took an additional 39 years for telephones to reach 40% penetration and another 15 before they became ubiquitous. Smart phones, on the other hand, accomplished a 40% penetration rate in just 10 years, if we time the first smart phone's introduction from the 2002 shipment of the first BlackBerry that could make phone calls and the first Palm-OS-powered Treo model [@McGrath2013].

This rise of adoption and penetration rates for new technologies suggests that technology is less and less primarily used by new generations, the so-called _Millenials_ or _Y generation_. In fact, these terms uncover less an age reality than technological use reality. Some analysts refer to the Y generation as the sociological group which is using the Information technologies most frequently, without explicitly stating an age. A 60 years old granny using social networks on mobile to communicate with her friends and family and buying things occasionnaly from e-commerce sites could be considered as belonging to the Y generation. The gaps in the world population regarding this revolution are not in terms of age, but in terms of usage.

As a results, the average human on this planet is more connected to all the other humans and communicates more with them than anytime in History. The world has never been so intertwined, in terms of information exchanges, even if the population has never been higher. Information is more available to anyone and anyone is more able to share information.

#### Competition for attention: People want simpler interactions

[TODO: citer Aberkane ici]

**Information is abundant, Attention is scarce:** Now that information is available so quickly, so ubiquitously, and so inexpensively, it is not surprising that everyone is complaining of information overload. Nobel prize-winning "economist Herbert Simon spoke for us all when he said that "a wealth of information creates a poverty of attention". Nowadays the problem is not information access but information overload. The real value produced by an information provider comes in locating, filtering, and communicating what is useful to the consumer. Any idiot can establish a Web presence, and lots of them have. The big problem is letting people know about it [@Shapiro1999].

Innovations create indirect substitutes for consumer time, attention, and money [@Gimpel2012].

Digital technologies create near-perfect transparency: consumers can switch among digital retailers. This dynamic can commoditize products and services as consumers demand comparable features and simple interactions [@Hirt2014].

The degree of consumer attention focused on a relatively small number of brands are redrawing battle lines [@Hirt2014]

Customers, too, are becoming more demanding. There is an "ever-rising tide of customer expectations" for service and convenience. They want to be more in charge. They expect that we know them more [@Westerman2011].

Some customers today favor self-service over personal interaction. For many young adults in their 20s and early 30s, interacting with a human service representative represents an inconvenience or an extra cost [@WESTERMAN2015].

#### Consumer-producer

Since digital news and information content can now be produced by amateurs in addition to professionals: Internet and digitization are competence-destroying and disruptive for the newspaper industry [@Karimi2015].

Millennialization of consumers has turned consumers into producers, empowered individuals to share their voices and influence others [@Gimpel2012].

**Community & Crowd:** If you build communities and you do things in public, you don't have to find the right people, they find you. An Exponential Organization interacting with its community is not simply a transaction There are three steps to building a community around an ExO:
  1. Use the MTP to attract and engage early members. The MTP serves as a gravitational force that attracts constituents into its orbit [@VanGeest2014].
  2. Nurture the community. Elements of nurturing include listening and giving back [@VanGeest2014].
  3. Create a platform to automate peer-to-peer engagement. Crowd is pull-based. You open up an idea, funding opportunity or incentive prize and let people find you [@VanGeest2014].

#### More information means empowerment of consumers and employees

Digital technologies also enable different forms of dynamic capabilities suitable for turbulent environments and transform the structure of social relationships in both the consumer and the enterprise space [@Bharadwaj2013].

Employees are asking why they cannot collaborate with coworkers the way they can with friends. Some younger employees have been heard saying "the company's more than 100 years old, but our IT capabilities don't have to match the age of the company." [@Westerman2011]

Enhancing interactions among customers, suppliers, stakeholders, and employees. Consumers and businesses increasingly prefer digital channels. These channels lower the cost of transactions [@Hirt2014].

Digital technologies know no borders, and the customer's demand for a unified experience is raising pressure on global companies to standardize offerings. They have come to expect payment systems that work across borders, global distribution, and a uniform customer experience [@Hirt2014].

This is because digital resources are “more than just bits and bytes, the digital infrastructure consists of institutions, practices, and protocols that together organize and deliver the increasing power of digital technology to business and society” (Deloitte 2009, p. 2) [@Bharadwaj2013].

Some people may say that we will never trust machines with important decisions such as the management of our health and money, but this is twentieth century thinking. A new generation (often called Millenials) is engaging with smart machines that they trust, and often prefer [@Beck2017].
