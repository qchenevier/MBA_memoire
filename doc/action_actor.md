## Stimulus from Actors

### Information is the medium bonding Machines and Humans

#### Information is the propagation of a message

First of all, what is Information ? We often hear about terms like _Big Data_, _Information Overflow_, _Knowledge Economy_, _Conventional Wisdom_ (or _Common Sense_), which all relate to the concept of Information, but they are not well defined. Is _Information Overflow_ another word for _Big Data_? What is this so-called _Knowledge_ in the _Knowledge Economy_? Are all those terms referring to the same concept?

The essential nature of Information, since it is fundamental to our existence, has been considered by many disciplines, including communications theory, library and information science, information systems, cognitive science, and organization science. This has generated multiple perspectives on the nature of information. Of our mundane and technical concepts information is currently one of the most important, most widely used and least understood [@Rowley2007].

A quick look at the [Information wikipedia page](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information) allows us to extract those notions:

> At its most fundamental level, information is any propagation of cause and effect within a system. Information is conveyed either as the content of a message or through direct or indirect observation of anything. Information was apparently derived from the latin verb _informare_ (to inform) in the sense of "to give form to the mind", "to discipline", "instruct", "teach". Often information can be viewed as a type of input to an organism or system, one which is not important to the organism's or system's existence (unlike food and energy). Information is any type of pattern that influences the formation or transformation of other patterns.

The first thing we can understand is that Information is the propagation of a message. And every aspect of Digitalization relates to the way messages are created more massively and propagating more efficiently in our societies.

#### Types of Information goods: Data, Information, Knowledge and Wisdom

The first widely-accepted Information Hierarchy has been proposed quite recently by @Ackoff1989. Ackoff's article, entitled _From data to wisdom_, proposed a hierarchy with the following levels: Data, Information, Knowledge, Understanding and Wisdom. He defines these elements and explores the processes associated with the transformation between these elements:

- _Data_ are defined as symbols that represent properties of objects, events and their environment. They are the products of observation, but are of no use until they are in a useable (i.e. relevant) form. The difference between data and information is functional, not structural [@Ackoff1989].
- _Information_ is contained in descriptions, answers to questions that begin with such words as who, what, when and how many. Information systems generate, store, retrieve and process data. Information is inferred from Data [@Ackoff1989].
- _Knowledge_ is know-how, and is what makes possible the transformation of information into instructions. Knowledge can be obtained either by transmission from another who has it, by instruction, or by extracting it from experience [@Ackoff1989].
- _Wisdom_ is the ability to increase effectiveness. Wisdom adds value, which requires the mental function that we call judgement. The ethical and aesthetic values that this implies are inherent to the actor and are unique and personal [@Ackoff1989].

Some authors have elaborated further on Ackoff's exposition, suggesting that _Understanding_ supports the transition from each stage to the next. They suggest that moving from Data to Information involves _understanding relations_, moving from Information to Knowledge involves _understanding patterns_, and moving from Knowledge to Wisdom involves _understanding principles_ [@Rowley2007].

All Informations have not the same level of complexity and value. Currently, we are creating Machines which are increasingly better at creating and processing the simplest Information goods: Data and Information. At the same time, Humans are increasingly creating and sharing the more complex Information goods: Knowledge and Wisdom. As we will see, it has several implications regarding the Value associated to the processing of this different kinds of Information goods by Humans.

#### Data is a raw signal: unstructured, meaningless and worthless

There is a strong consensus around the definition of Data [@Rowley2007]:

- Data has no meaning or value because it is without context and interpretation.
- Data are discrete, objective facts or observations, which are unorganized and unprocessed, and do not convey any specific meaning.
- Data items are an elementary and recorded description of things, events, activities and transactions.

Interestingly, these definitions are largely in terms of what data lacks; data lacks meaning or value, is unorganized and unprocessed. They lay the foundations for defining information in terms of data [@Rowley2007].

Data, as seen by computers, has 3 fundamental properties: [@Iansiti2014]

- Digital signals can be transmitted perfectly without error
- Digital signals can be replicated indefinitely
- Digital signals can be communicated to the incremental consumer at zero marginal cost

Data examples:

- The bits (0/1) on a hard drive.
- An array containing numbers or text.

#### From the Data of Machines to the Wisdom of Humans: Meaning and Value

Interestingly those authors who draw the hierarchy offer a number of different views on the variables that change between the different levels of the hierarchy [@Rowley2007]:

- meaning and value
- human input and computer input
- algorithmicity and programmability
- order, structure and human agency

On one end of the spectrum, Data has no value and no meaning for Humans, is only for Computers to be treated with algorithms. Whereas Wisdom is valuable and meaningful for Humans, cannot be recorded in a computer and cannot be programmatically extracted.

Information and Knowledge being at the interface between Humans and Machines are all the rage in today's technological revolution. Mastering an understanding the elements at the interface of those two worlds are the key to understand the current technological revolution. Now, the Humanity is learning to use Machines to deliver Meaning & Value, i.e. answering questions for better decisions, to Humans. This is the paradigm of the current techno-economic revolution.

#### Information is Data completed by a Meaning

The concepts of format, structure, organization, meaning and value feature in the various definitions [@Rowley2007]:

- Information is formatted data and can be defined as a representation of reality.
- Information is data which adds value to the understanding of a subject.
- Information is data that have been shaped into a form that is meaningful and useful to human beings.
- Information is data that have been organized so that they have meaning and value to the recipient.
- Information is data processed for a purpose.

There are a number of definitions of information in common use, which they suggest are [@Rowley2007]:

- Data that have been processed so that they are meaningful.
- Data that have been processed for a purpose.
- Data that have been interpreted and understood by the recipient.

The processes associated with converting data into information are: classification, rearranging/sorting, aggregating, performing calculations, and selection. Such processing of data requires a decision about the type of analysis, and this, in turn, requires an interpretation of the content of the data. To be relevant and have a purpose, information must be considered within the context where it is received and used [@Rowley2007].

To conclude, in both the information systems textbooks and the knowledge management literature, information is defined in terms of data, and is seen to be organized or structured data [@Rowley2007].

Information examples:

- A list of facts: _The door has been closed at 19:38._
- A picture (computed from an array of number, given the file format)
- An array of numbers or text with labels (or column names) and some metadata information about the date and location when the data has been measured, with which instrument.

#### Information & Knowledge Value relates to Decision-making {#information-value}

An author defines knowledge as 'actionable information', and proposes that actionable information allows us to make better decisions and to provide an effective input to dialogue and creativity in organizations. Another author suggests that knowledge may be viewed as an understanding of information based on its perceived importance or relevance to a problem area [@Rowley2007].

Economically, the main definition of Value of Information is: how much answering a question allows a decision-maker to improve its decision [@Howard1966].

- "answering": Value of Information is dependent of the all possible answers and their relative likelihood.
- "improve": Value of Information isn't about sleeping better at night. If the expected value of the information (the chance you change your decision after receiving the information times the relative value of the decisions) is lower than the cost of the information, just bite the bullet and don't run the test you were considering.
- "decision": Value of Information isn't just curiosity. Information has Value only if some decision has to depend on that fact.

In other words, information is valuable lies by reducing uncertainty in decisions. According to @Hirshleifer1971 there are 2 types of economical uncertainty: Market Uncertainty and Technology Uncertainty, and hence, Information is able to create Value by helping Decision making regarding those two uncertainties:

- Market uncertainty happens when an individual is imperfectly informed about his market opportunities, i.e. about the supply-demand offers of others: there are costly patterns of search for trading partners, which replace the traditional assumption of costless exchange [@Hirshleifer1971].
- Technological uncertainty happens when individuals are unsure about the size of their own commodity endowments and/or about the returns attainable from their own productive investments [@Hirshleifer1971].

For example, with his knowledge, the Medical Doctor is able to produce on the spot a diagnosis, which is an information which can be used to improve the Decision. Without this information, the best decision would be to try all the available treatments. It's interesting to see that as Medical Knowledge is constituted by the community of Doctors and shared during medical training, it improves over time and then older doctors with older knowledge take worse decisions than their younger colleagues. It has been shown by @Tsugawa2017: Within the same hospital, patients treated by older physicians had higher mortality than patients cared for by younger physicians, except those physicians treating high volumes of patients. Their collective knowledge, i.e. the state-of-the-art, is naturally progressing to give better decision and a higher value.

To be valuable on a Market, according to @Hirshleifer1971, an Information or Knowledge should be Prior, Sure and Private:

- Prior: obviously, the information must be available before a decision is made.
- Sure: if the Information is not sure, it is not reducing the uncertainty. It cannot help improve a decision. Most frequently, this _sure_ aspect is not verifiable and, consequently, is reduced to the perception of the decision-maker. To be valuable in the eyes of a decision-maker, an Information must be able to . That's why most information providers invest time and effort to create strong brands which convey an image of trust and certainty. This has a direct impact on the perceived value of their informations.
- Private: An information provider cannot capture any value if it already known by everyone. The value capture from this information happens only through the release of this information. It means that if an Information stays private forever, no one will benefit from it, not even thw owner. This release could be indirect though (e.g: when a market bubble pops): when an actor changes his behavior on a market ("This asset is overvalued: I sell everything !"), the other actors are often analyzing this change of behavior ("He sells everything !") and hence, retrieving indirectly the information ("We understand that you think that the asset is overvalued"). \
This privacy aspect has to be nuanced with the fact that many informations are public or easily accessible and hence not valuable but require very little additional private information to be valuable. "I know that there is a public information here which suits your needs" is the kind of additional information provided by the search business.

In a further part, we refine the various ways of [creating Information Value](#value-creation).

#### Knowledge is a combination of Informations into an Algorithm

Knowledge is typically defined with reference to information, but some discuss the processes that convert information into knowledge, whilst others identify the 'added ingredients'. The processes that convert information into knowledge are variously described as [@Rowley2007]:

- synthesis of multiple sources of information over time.
- belief structuring.  
- study and experience.
- organization and processing to convey understanding, experience, accumulated learning and experience.
- internalization with reference to cognitive frameworks.

The 'added ingredients' definitions suggest variously that knowledge is [@Rowley2007]:

- a mix of contextual information, values, experience, and rules.
- information, expert opinion, skills and experience.
- information combined with understanding and capability.
- perception, skills, training, common sense, and experience.

Knowledge is an intrinsically ambiguous and equivocal term. There is still no consensus on the nature of knowledge, except that it is based on perception that can provide a rational justification for it [@Rowley2007]:

- Knowledge is the combination of data and information, to which is added expert opinion, skills, and experience, to result in a valuable asset which can be used to aid decision making.
- Knowledge is data and/or information that have been organized and processed to convey understanding, experience, accumulated learning, and expertise as they apply to a current problem or activity.
- Knowledge builds on information that is extracted from data. While data is a property of things, knowledge is a property of people that predisposes them to act in a particular way.

What we understand here is that Knowledge is no more than an Algorithm, i.e. a list of steps to combine Information into a more valuable Information result. Having discovered patterns in Information, a Human is able to produce a Knowledge of those patterns to create useful Information from useless Information.

There is a difference between tacit knowledge which is embedded in the individual and explicit knowledge which is residing in documents, databases and other recorded formats [@Rowley2007]. So Human Knowledge can be extracted and stored into Machines with some effort.  

In mathematics and computer science, an [Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm) is a self-contained sequence of actions to be performed. Algorithms can perform calculation, data processing and automated reasoning tasks.

The world is pretty much run on algorithms [@VanGeest2014]. Software and algorithms can be seen as Human Knowledge freezed and transcribed so that a Machine can exploit it to treat Information.

For example, Medical Doctors use their knowledge to create diagnosis information which improves health of their patients. Their knowledge has been constituted by studying a number of medical cases with their symptoms, the treatments which were tried and the results which were obtained. The knowledge of the Doctor will consist in a list of algorithms such as: "given those symptoms, here is the best treatment we found until now". The Doctor doesn't deliver any of his knowledge, he delivers an information: "you need this treatment to treat your condition".

#### Knowledge grows through Combination

To become knowledge, new insights are internalized by establishing links with already existing knowledge, and these links can range from firmly characterized relationships to vague associations. Prior knowledge is used to make sense of received information, and once accepted for inclusion, internalizes the new insights by linking with prior knowledge. Hence, the new knowledge is as much a function of prior knowledge as it is of received inputs. Some authors mention the importance of the semantic aspects of information in the creation of knowledge [@Rowley2007].

Property compositions may be linear in general. From a saver's point of view adding one kilograms of rice to another kilograms of rice is something linear, and makes two kilograms of rice. As long as processes are not involved thus, property composition is linear. This does not apply to knowledge compositions however, precisely in that knowledge is a process. The composition of two elements of knowledge systematically generates a third one, which is anywhere between trivial (but non-null) and revolutionary [@Aberkane2016]. In other words, the paradigm for growing Information-based assets is not displacement and replacement, but rather **connectivity and recombination** [@Iansiti2014].

Knowledge may thus be considered to "reproduce" in a way, and the difference between knowing two things separately and knowing them together may be called the "fertility" of knowledge, which is somehow comparable to the notion of entrepreneurial added value. This fertility accounts for the intrinsic prolificity of knowledge. We may also oversimplify this paradigm by calling the fertility of knowledge "serendipity", that is, the fortuitous creation of novel knowledge from the collision of several distinct bits of knowledge [@Aberkane2016].

From an economic and political point of view, knowledge may very well be the only potentially infinite resource that is offered to Humanity. We know very well that infinite growth is impossible if it is purely based on raw materials, which are finite, even when they are renewable. But infinite growth is not impossible if it is knowledge-based [@Aberkane2016].

#### Wisdom is the accumulation of Knowledge {#wisdom}

Ulimately the growth of Knowledge is leading to the creation of new conventional wisdom, also called common-sense by @Perez2004.

Wisdom perhaps has more to do with human intuition, understanding, interpretation and actions, than with systems. Some authors see wisdom as accumulated knowledge, which allows you to understand how to apply concepts from one domain to new situations or problems. In the knowledge management literature, some authors suggest that Wisdom is the highest level of abstraction, with vision foresight and the ability to see beyond the horizon [@Rowley2007].

Wy do we even consider Wisdom in this essay? How this concept could be related to Organizational efficiency? This seems quite counter-intuitive to consider Wisdom at a time when all of our understandings about the economic world and our beliefs seem to be challenged. In fact, it may be one the most important aspect of the knowledge economy, yet underrated by the literature: by adopting a new range of techologies, our societies are also constituting a new wisdom. Some authors suggest that we are currently transiting from one conventional wisdom to another:

- Digital resources are "more than just bits and bytes, the digital infrastructure consists of institutions, practices, and protocols that together organize and deliver the increasing power of digital technology to business and society" [@Bharadwaj2013].
- As the new paradigm unfolds in the economy, its logic propagates towards all of society, modifying the common sense criteria that guide all sorts of organizations and eventually resulting in maximum social synergy [@Perez2004].

Some authors suggest that since knowledge is more and more available and yet has still to be improved in most organizations, organizations' leaders should focus on spreading a new wisdom, bringing a new vision, letting employees with the task of creating the new orgniazational knowledge. We refine this aspect in the part about [Vision](#vision).

### Machines and Information are growing in symbiose

#### Data, Information and Knowledge flows are Positive-Sum

Data, Information, Knowledge and Wisdom are all immaterial goods. And hence have different properties than material goods when they are exchanged. One of the most clear formulation of their different properties has been coined by the french writer & entrepreneur Serge Soudoplatoff (cited by @Aberkane2016):

> When one shares a material good, one divides it. When one shares an immaterial good, one multiplies it.

Since knowledge is an immaterial good, sharing it does not divide it, but rather multiplies it and also makes it evolve. Its economics, also, is one of fluxes rather than one of stocks, in which ownership must clearly be redefined [@Aberkane2016].

As a result, Knowledge exchanges are Positive-Sum. This is a re-expression of Soudoplatoff's law. Material exchanges are Zero-Sum, whereas immaterial exchanges, such as knowledge exchanges, are Positive-Sum [@Aberkane2016].

This property could help explain the exponential growth of Information we are describing in the next parts.

This property also has an impact on the fear of loss: sharing an information doesn't mean you loose it. You may miss an opportunity of capturing some value from the release of this information, but you still have the ability to use the Information once you have released it. The only way to create and capture some value with Information is to release it in some way.

Positive-Sum exchanges also mean that, Immaterial goods economics are not subject to all the limitations of material goods due to management of scarcity, depletion, etc. It has several implication on the value creation and capture mechanisms which are described in the following parts: [Create Information Value](#value-creation) and [Capture Information Value](#value-capture)

Please note that this rule of thumb does not comprehend the notion of Value of Information, which is studied by Game Thoery and Economics.

#### Information Technology's performance is growing exponentially

Futurist Ray Kurzweil made 4 signature observations about the evolution of Information technology [@VanGeest2014]:

1. First, the doubling pattern identified by Gordon Moore in integrated circuits applies to any information technology. Kurzweil calls this the Law of Accelerating Returns (LOAR) and shows that doubling patterns in computation extend all the way back to 1900, far earlier than Moore's original pronouncement.
2. Second, the driver fueling this phenomenon is information. Once any domain, discipline, technology or industry becomes information-enabled and powered by information flows, its price/performance begins doubling approximately annually.
3. Third, once that doubling pattern starts, it doesn't stop.
4. Finally, several key technologies today are now information-enabled and following the same trajectory. Those technologies include Artificial Intelligence (AI), robotics, biotech and bioinformatics, medicine, neuroscience, data science, 3D printing, nanotechnology and even aspects of energy.

The explosive transition from film to digital photography is now occurring in several accelerating technologies. We are information-enabling everything. An information-enabled environment delivers fundamentally disruptive opportunities. E.g: the cheapest 3D printers now cost only \$ 100, which means that within five years or so most of us will be able to afford 3D printers to fabricate toys, cutlery, tools and fittings. Essentially anything we're able to dream up [@VanGeest2014].

#### Information Technology is becoming Ubiquitous

As seen in the introduction, [each technological revolution has its key factor](#technological-revolution) and the key factor of the current Information & telecommunications revolution is cheap electronic chips. In each case, the "key factor" steers engineering and investment decisions towards its intensive use. New technology systems are built accordingly, based on microelectronics, software & telecommunications [@Perez2004].

The post-dotcom decade has seen firms, both established and startups, taking advantage of lower price/performance levels of computing (hardware and software) as well as global connectivity through standard protocols (e.g., Internet and mobile web) [@Bharadwaj2013]. Today the focus is on connectivity, platforms, data, and software. These spread faster than classic computing hardware due to their network effects and the marginal cost economics associated with it [@Manyika2015]. Information goods, powerful computing devices, and inexpensive digital communication are changing business and society [@Gimpel2012].

#### Data and Information are growing exponentially: Big Data everywhere

The digital universe is made up of images and videos on mobile phones uploaded to YouTube, digital movies populating the pixels of our high-definition TVs, banking data swiped in an ATM, security footage at airports and major events such as the Olympic Games, subatomic collisions recorded by the Large Hadron Collider at CERN, transponders recording highway tolls, voice calls zipping through digital phone lines, and texting as a widespread means of communications [@Gantz2012].

In the past we have operated under conditions of data (and information) scarcity with decisions made with incomplete and often poor quality (even time-lapsed) data. Big Data create conditions of data (and information) abundance due to the massive amount of detailed (and often ready to analyze) data made available [@Bharadwaj2013].

From 2005 to 2020, the digital universe will grow by a factor of 300, from 130 exabytes to 40,000 exabytes, or 40 trillion gigabytes (more than 5,200 gigabytes for every man, woman, and child in 2020). From now until 2020, the digital universe will double about every two years [@Gantz2012].

Examples of currently exploding (and potentially valuable) data sources [@Gantz2012]:

- Surveillance footage: as IP cameras continue to proliferate, footage can be captured, analyzed, and tagged in real time. This type of tagging can expedite crime investigations, enhance retail analytics for consumer traffic patterns, and, of course, improve military intelligence.
- Embedded and medical devices: In the future, sensors of all types (including those that may be implanted into the body) will capture vital and nonvital biometrics, all in real time.
- Entertainment and social media: Trends based on crowds can help pick winners and losers in the stock market, and even predict the outcome of elections.
- Consumer images: We say a lot about ourselves when we post pictures of ourselves or our families or friends.
- Transactions: in addition, of course, to the normal transactional data running through enterprise computers in the course of normal data processing today.

#### Automated Knowledge generation through Machine Learning.

During the last 2 decades, we already witnessed that specific computer Algorithms could beat the Human world champions at games, which are specific controlled environments:

- Gerald Tesauro's TD-Gammon has beaten Backgammon Champions in 1992 [@Tesauro1995]
- IBM's Deep Blue has beaten Chess Champion Gary Kasparov in 1997 [@Campbell2002]
- IBM's Watson has beaten Jeopardy (a TV Question-Answering contest) Champions in 2011 [@Ferrucci2013]
- Deepmind's AlphaGo has beaten Go champion Lee Sedol in 2016 [@Hassabis2016]

Those Algorithms have all been generated thanks to Machine Learning.

Machine Learning is the ability to accurately perform new, unseen tasks, built on known properties learned from training or historic data [@VanGeest2014]. Machine Learning Algorithms are Meta-Algorithms, in a sense that they are Algorithms that create other Algorithms. In other words, Machine Learning Algorithms create automatically new Algorithms from Data, trying to reduce the error rate on a specific algorithmic task, much like a biologic entity (Human or Animal) would do through learning. Humans have transcribed in Machine Learning Algorithms the most basic way how Humans derive Knowledge from Information. Machine Learning is able to create an Algorithm by looking at Data.

#### Machine Learning Algorithms are encroaching Human Knowledge workers skills

In less controlled environment than games, Machine Learning is getting good results in more and more scientific fields: Character Recognition in the early 90s, Speech Recognition in the 2010s, Computer Vision in 2014 and now Natural Language Processing (see Yann Lecun's [post on facebook](https://www.facebook.com/yann.lecun/posts/10154498539442143)). Those results are deemed good becase those algorithms are much faster and on par with humans' accuracy on those increasingly complex tasks:

- Character Recognition AI is now widely used to process automatically many types of documents (invoices, purchase orders) and in postal sorting offices to read hand-written adresses [@Marinai2005].
- Speech Recognition AI is now used in search engine applications on smartphones or used to power phone-answering-robots in call centers.
- Computer Vision AI is used by Facebook to recognize faces [@Taigman2014] and has been used in medical image analysis for decades [@DeBruijne2016].
- Natural Language Processing AI is used by Google to improve its Google Translate tool [@Castelvecchi2016].     

Many skilled jobs are cognitive jobs (like Doctors, Financial advisers, Business consultants) and follow the same Information-based workflow: [@Beck2017]

1. Gather data
2. Analyze the data
3. Interpret the results
4. Determine a recommended course of action
5. Implement the course of action

Highly skilled workers can command high rates because of three capabilities. Their abilities to go through the early rote tasks quickly and accurately; their experiences and judgment in determining a course of action; and their savviness for helping clients navigate that course. AI and Machine Learning will quickly surpass our abilities on the first two capabilities. It’s easy to see the role of automated systems in data gathering and analysis, we’ve accepted that machines can do these types of tasks efficiently. However, their potential goes much further [@Beck2017].

### Humans are contributing with Meaning & Value

#### Humans are more and more Information Producers {#prosumerization}

Many people suggest that rates of new product introduction and adoption are speeding up since centuries. It seems to be true: It took decades for the telephone to reach 50% of households, beginning before 1900, whereas it took five years or less for cellphones to accomplish the same penetration in 1990. And innovations introduced more recently are being adopted more quickly [@McGrath2013].

It took 30 years for electricity and 25 years for telephones to reach 10% adoption but less than five years for tablet devices to achieve the 10% rate. It took an additional 39 years for telephones to reach 40% penetration and another 15 before they became ubiquitous. Smart phones, on the other hand, accomplished a 40% penetration rate in just 10 years, if we time the first smart phone's introduction from the 2002 shipment of the first BlackBerry that could make phone calls and the first Palm-OS-powered Treo model [@McGrath2013].

This rise of adoption and penetration rates for new technologies suggests that technology is less and less the prerogative of the new generations, the so-called _Millenials_ or _Y generation_. In fact, these so-called generations are bounded less by an age criterion than by a technological use one. Some analysts refer to the Y generation as the sociological group which is using the Information technologies most frequently, without explicitly stating an age. A 60 years old granny using social networks on mobile to communicate with her friends and family and buying things occasionnaly from e-commerce sites could be considered as belonging to the Y generation. The gaps in the world population regarding this revolution are not in terms of age, but in terms of usage.

This increased technology usage means that people are producing more and more information directly by giving feedback or indirectly throught the usage statistics of their devices. This is the rise of the _consumer-producer_, a phenomenon called _Prosumerization_ or _Millenialization_:

- Millennialization of consumers has turned consumers into producers, empowered individuals to share their voices and influence others [@Gimpel2012].
- Since digital news and information content can now be produced by amateurs in addition to professionals: Internet and digitization are competence-destroying and disruptive for the newspaper industry [@Karimi2015].

As a results, the average human on this planet is more connected to all the other humans and communicates more with them than anytime in History. The world has never been so intertwined, in terms of information exchanges, even if the population has never been higher. Information is more available to anyone and anyone is more able to create or share information.

#### Humans have more Relationships & Interactions through (and with) Machines thanks to Telecommunications

Digital technologies also enable different forms of dynamic capabilities suitable for turbulent environments and transform the structure of social relationships in both the consumer and the enterprise space [@Bharadwaj2013].

Employees are asking why they cannot collaborate with coworkers the way they can with friends. Some younger employees have been heard saying "the company's more than 100 years old, but our IT capabilities don't have to match the age of the company." [@Westerman2011]

Information technologies are enhancing interactions among customers, suppliers, stakeholders, and employees. Consumers and businesses increasingly prefer digital channels, as these channels lower the cost of transactions [@Hirt2014].

For example, some customers today favor self-service over personal interaction. For many young adults in their 20s and early 30s, interacting with a human service representative represents an inconvenience or an extra cost [@WESTERMAN2015].

Some people may say that we will never trust machines with important decisions such as the management of our health and money, but this is twentieth century thinking. A new generation (often called Millenials) is engaging with smart machines that they trust, and often prefer [@Beck2017].

#### Information & Knowledge transfer to Humans is constrained by Time and Attention {#attention-time}

There is a difference between explicit knowledge and tacit knowledge suggesting that explicit knowledge can be recorded in information systems, whereas tacit knowledge cannot be recorded since it is part of the human mind. Tacit knowledge is embedded in the individual, whilst explicit knowledge is codified and recorded, and as such is designed for sharing [@Rowley2007].

However, the sharing of Information and Knowledge to Humans is not instantaneous. According to @Aberkane2016: Property exchanges may be considered instantaneous, and of course, scalable. However, knowledge exchanges take time. Knowledge exchanges, unlike properties exchanges, are flows.

What is it that we spend indeed in acquiring conceptual knowledge from a book, a video game or a course? Attention and time. The amount of flowed knowledge is proportional to their product, in that spending one hour and zero attention surely implies a null transfer, and spending all one's attention for less than even the subliminal perceptual threshold also implies a null flow [@Aberkane2016].

As a result, @Aberkane2016 suggests a raw estimate to understand the knowledge flows to humans: "the amount of flowed knowledge follows the product of attention and time". The product of attention and time becomes the most essential currency of the Knowledge Economy [@Aberkane2016]. This also has been understood by @Gimpel2012, when he states that: Innovations create indirect substitutes for consumer time, attention, and money.

This has been understood already by some media visionaries, as Patrick Lelay, CEO of TF1, the leader of the french TV industry:

> _There are many ways of talking about television. But, from a business perspective, let's be realistic: basically TF1's job is to help, say, Coca-Cola, to sell its product. For an advertising message to be perceived, the viewer's brain must be available. The purpose of our broadcasts is to make it available, that is, to divert it, to relax it, in order to make it ready between two ads. What we are selling to Coca-Cola is available human brain time._

When it was formulated in 2004, this statement has been perceived as cynical and dystopian, yet it shows the value provided by media companies: availability, which can be understood as attention, and time.

It has to be noted that the equivalent of Attention and Time for a computer is bandwith. Of course, Transforming Human Knowledge into Software (Machine Knowledge) requires the Time and Attention of a talented Software Developer. But once it is done, transferring the software from one machine to another is nearly only limited by bandwith. That means that all transfers of Information and Knowledge are limited by Attention and Time if the emitter and/or the receiver is Human. If both the emitter and the receiver are Machines, the Information transfers are only limited by the Information technology they are using.

#### Competition for Attention is empowering Humans

Information is abundant, Attention is scarce: Now that information is available so quickly, so ubiquitously, and so inexpensively, it is not surprising that everyone is complaining of information overload. Nobel prize-winning "economist Herbert Simon spoke for us all when he said that "a wealth of information creates a poverty of attention". Nowadays the problem is not information access but information overload. The real value produced by an information provider comes in locating, filtering, and communicating what is useful to the consumer. Any idiot can establish a Web presence, and lots of them have. The big problem is letting people know about it [@Shapiro1999].

Digital technologies create near-perfect transparency: consumers can switch among digital retailers. This dynamic can commoditize products and services as consumers demand comparable features and simple interactions [@Hirt2014].

The degree of consumer attention focused on a relatively small number of brands are redrawing battle lines [@Hirt2014]. Customers are becoming more demanding. There is an "ever-rising tide of customer expectations" for service and convenience. They want to be more in charge. They expect that we know them more [@Westerman2011]. Digital technologies know no borders, and the customer's demand for a unified experience is raising pressure on global companies to standardize offerings. They have come to expect payment systems that work across borders, global distribution, and a uniform customer experience [@Hirt2014].

#### Knowledge transfer to Machines is constrained by Design Talent

We saw in [another part](#attention-time), that Knowledge transfer to Machines is contrained by the time and attention of talented software developer. As a result, software development and design talent are  human skills which are increasingly important, as the Knowledge economy rises in importance. The competition to hire talent is now global, as technologies evolve faster and technology usage is exploding to increase automation.

Successful start-ups known for digital expertise and engineer-friendly cultures become magnets for the best digital talent [@Hirt2014].

There are Growing talent mismatches between companies. Companies are struggling to find the right talent in areas that can't be automated. Such areas include digital skills like those of artificial-intelligence programmers or data scientists and of people who lead digital strategies and think creatively about new business designs. One global company, for example, is simultaneously planning to cut more than 10,000 employees (some through digital economies) while adding 3,000 to its digital business [@Hirt2014].

Between 2012 and 2020, the patch of the digital universe that CIOs and their IT staffs need to manage will become not just bigger but also more complex. The skills, experience, and resources to manage all these bits of data will become scarcer and more specialized, requiring a new, flexible, and scalable IT infrastructure that extends beyond the enterprise [@Gantz2012].

Between 2014 and 2020, the amount of data managed per each IT professional will increase 6-fold, from 230 gigabytes in 2014 to 1231 gigabytes in 2020, requiring new abilities to scale up infrastructure and analytics to manage this data [@IDC/EMC2014].

For these workers, in US, wage growth has been approximately twice as fast as the national average in the most highly digitized industries and those who lack digital skills face narrowing job prospects [@Manyika2015].

#### Human Skills transfer to Machines is accelerating thanks to Machine Learning

The booming growth of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence (AI), like most transformational technologies, is both exciting and scary, considering the social and personal implications, and particularly the implications for our careers. As AI improves, which is happening quickly, a much broader set of "thinking" rather than "doing" jobs will be aﬀected. Jobs, that, until the last few years, we couldn't imagine being done without the participation of an actual, trained human being [@Beck2017]. Some 60 percent of occupations could have 30 percent or more of their activities automated. Workers of all skill levels, including highly skilled professionals, will not be immune [@Manyika2015]. The Idea that technological advances favor more skilled workers is a twentieth century phenomenon [@Acemoglu2002]. It's long been known that AI and automation/robotics will change markets and workforces. We all need to develop new skills in order to diﬀerentiate ourselves [@Beck2017].

Software replaces labor in digital businesses. Computers increasingly are performing complex tasks. Even knowledge-intensive areas, such as oncology diagnostics, are susceptible to challenge by machines [@Hirt2014]. Middle-skill occupations such as clerical, sales, production, and operational roles will be highly impacted. Automation could displace from 10 to 15 percent of these jobs in the decade ahead, which would represent a sharp acceleration of historical displacement rates [@Manyika2015]. Digitization will encroach on a growing number of knowledge roles within companies as they automate many front-line and middle-management jobs based upon synthesizing information for C-level executives [@Hirt2014].

Technology is beginning to encroach on human skills. There is growing anxiety about job losses, but IT technology creates the need for new roles [@Manyika2015]. According to @Frey2017, 3 Tasks categories won't be automated:

- **Perception & Manipulation** tasks: especially in unstructured work environment (personal house vs airport or train station), irregular objects [@Frey2017].
- **Creative Intelligence** tasks: it's making unfamiliar combinations for familiar ideas and find which ones make sense. E.g: jokes. Value of creativity is inherently subjective, so evaluation of a robot on creative Intelligence tasks is difficult [@Frey2017].
- **Social intelligence** tasks: involving negotiation, persuasion and care [@Frey2017].

Those that want to stay relevant in their professions will need to focus on skills and capabilities that Artificial Intelligence has trouble replicating - understanding, motivating, and interacting with human beings. These human capabilities that will become more and more prized over the next decade. Skills like persuasion, social understanding, and empathy are going to become diﬀerentiators as Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning take over our other tasks. Unfortunately, these human-oriented skills have generally been viewed as second priority in terms of training and education [@Beck2017].

#### Human physical skills are trivialized by Automation, Robotics, 3D printing & Additive manufacturing

New technologies such as robotics, 3-D printing, augmented reality and the "Internet of Things" will soon lead to major business changes [@WESTERMAN2015].

Digitization has contributed to increasingly jobless recoveries from recessions. The postwar US economy took roughly six months to recover lost jobs after every recession. But it took 15 months to restore lost jobs after the 1991 recession, 39 months after 2001, and 43 months after 2008 [@Manyika2015].

Digitization has contributed to hollowing out the middle-skill portion of the US workforce. Since 2000, the US has created 8 million jobs : only low-skill interactive jobs or high-skill interactive jobs. Whereas, 2.5 million production and transaction jobs have been destroyed [@Manyika2015].

In terms of wages, digitization has accelerated a divergence between the majority of workers and a smaller group at the top. And, since 1980, labor productivity has grown 2.5 times faster than wages, breaking historical patterns [@Manyika2015].
