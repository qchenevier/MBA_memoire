#### About this work {-}

When I first started to review all kinds of materials about Digitalization, I have been overwhelmed by the amount of different conceptual frameworks proposed to understand the phenomenon. At first sight, it seems that every author understands Digitalization differently and suggests different solutions.

I have recomposed all those contributions into one federating work to show that, as these authors see Digitalization from their point of view, they are, in fact, all stating the same facts and suggesting (kind of) similar solutions. I have analyzed all these contributions differing in form and structure and harmonized them in a single work, as if the authors were having a structured conversation about Digitalization.

The present work is a combination of citations of numerous philosophers, economists & business thinkers. I tried to cite them as precisely as I could without altering their work. As a result, 90 % of this work is made of raw citations. Each citation is outlined by parenthesis containing the author's name, the year of publication and a link to the reference (e.g: [@Perez2004]). The remaining 10 % are my adding of several explanations, sometimes necessary to link together some citations.

This harmonization work has proven more difficult than forethought, as authors use different words for the same concepts and have differing styles. Consequently, the writing style of this work is heterogeneous and may lack the aesthetical harmony that would be given by the reformulation by a single author of all these ideas and concepts.
