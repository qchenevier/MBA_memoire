#### Strategic principles for competing in the digital age [@Hirt2014]

Opportunities and threats:

- **Enhancing interactions** among customers, suppliers, stakeholders, and employees
- **Improving management decisions** as algorithms crunch big data from social technologies or the Internet of Things
- **Enabling new business or operating models**, such as peer-to-peer product innovation or customer service

7 forces at work:

1. New pressure on prices and margins
1. Competitors emerge from unexpected places
1. Winner-takes-all dynamics
1. Plug-and-play business models
1. Growing talent mismatches
1. Converging global supply and demand
1. Relentlessly evolving business models at higher velocity

Managing the strategic challenges: Six big decisions

- Decision 1: Buy or sell businesses in your portfolio?
- Decision 2: Lead your customers or follow them?
- Decision 3: Cooperate or compete with new attackers? (link with @Iansiti2014: GE's doing more partnerships)
- Decision 4: Diversify or double down on digital initiatives? (_potential_ link with @Woodard2013: Augment the design capital by augmenting the options or diminish the technical debt)
- Decision 5: Keep digital businesses separate or integrate them with current nondigital ones? (link with @Karimi2015: depending on the characteristics (size, existing assets, agility needed, risk aversion...), some have integrated or not the digital business unit)
- Decision 6: Delegate or own the digital agenda?

##### Quotes

**Execution challenges:**

- **Missing skills:** While a top-level impetus for transformation is important, it is often not enough. Analytics-based decision-making does not always come naturally to people accustomed to using "professional judgment". Emerging technologies are another area where skills may be scarce internally, especially in areas such as mobility and social media. Firms are filling gaps by hiring experts or working with vendors. A firm of the study, aiming to limit long-term HR investment while experimenting with new technologies, is working with vendors who have the right skills. However, it is encountering knowledge integration issues as key skills are located in different vendors.

- **Culture issues:** Cultural issues can also become a bottleneck for digital transformation. A major cultural issue is related to changes in jobs due to automation or information empowerment. The firm's information-based benefits are reduced by managers who cannot think differently about how they make decisions. There is also a need to change the culture when empowering front-line workers. These workers needed help to adopt the idea of using new information capabilities to make autonomous decisions. On another level, previously autonomous country managers require coaching to grow comfortable working in an environment of centralized shared services and standardized processes. One lever for change is to hire new leaders bringing new skills, also bringing a new vision. Senior executives cite a strong vision and frequent communication as essential for driving culture change. Labor relations issues are a stickier source of culture change issues. Employees, fearing job cuts, are strongly resistant.

- **IT Difficulties:** Digital initiatives are built on a solid foundation of technology-enabled processes and data, as well as the analytics, solution delivery and relationship capabilities to create and extend that platform. Many companies find their information technology infrastructures and capabilities severely lacking. "We don't retire systems. We just add on top of them, which creates a tremendous amount of expense and complexity." "It is very difficult to get a good understanding of the customer when customer data is spread across so many systems." A history of poor business / IT relations is a difficult foundation for the collaborative work required in digital transformation. "IT is a mess. Their costs are not acceptable. They propose things in 9-10 months where external firms could do them in 3-9 weeks.

- **Governance challenges:** Benefiting from transformation typically requires changes in processes or decision-making that span traditional organizational or functional structures. Organizational change requires top-down effort to help employees envision a different reality. The largest benefits of digital transformation come from truly transforming activities. This requires a more radical vision: one that offers a view of a different way of working, not just a faster or more efficient one. Unless senior executives establish a transformative vision of the future, managers in the rest of the firm will tend to locally optimize within their own spheres of authority. Whereas an overarching vision can span organizational boundaries. Envisioning a single entity with local offices, rather than a collection of independent units, so that each can rapidly adjust to what is learned in another area. These overarching visions establish a picture of what is legitimate and help to delegitimize local behavior that detracts from a more global approach. More common than a lack of vision is a vision that does not go far enough. Overly limited visions can dramatically affect the value obtained from each digital transformation investment.

- **Coordination issues:** Many firms fail to transform because of coordination difficulties across business units or processes. Units are able to make progress in their own areas, but are unable to influence practices in other units. A firm is even investing in coordination and created a digital division to ensure that all of its digital efforts are being coordinated. A further concern arises from coordination issues between new and traditional businesses or processes: conflict is real, and can be very painful for managers in traditional units that lose when new businesses gain. It often must be addressed through an overarching vision.

Successful digital transformations used a common set of elements:
- diagnose the potential value of existing corporate assets
- build a transformative vision for the future
- invest in skills and initiatives to make the vision a reality

These elements work together in an iterative approach, constantly communicating and listening to re-envision and further implement new types of digital transformation. It's an iterative three-step process:

1. Envision the digital future for your firm.
2. Invest in digital initiatives and skills.
3. Lead the change from the top.

**Envision the digital future for your firm**: Many digital transformation initiatives fail to capture all of the value available to them because their vision is not transformative.

- **Identify and diagnose strategic assets:** Large companies survive major transitions not by radically replacing the old with the new, but rather by transforming some of their existing resources and competencies for the new environment and reassigning or adapting assets and realigning or re-motivating employees. Your company will thrive in digital transformation not by doing something completely new, but by taking advantage of your powerful capabilities to gain advantage through digitization. What assets will be useful in a digitally transformed world?
  - **Sales force:** source of customer loyalty is the set of relationships cultivated by a strong sales force. Digital initiatives can threaten to disintermediate salespeople. However, digital transformation can also be used to enhance those relationships.
  - **Point of sale and distribution channels:** Stores are often a strong source of location-based advantage, even in a digital world.
  - **Products and content:** Product companies often find they can build new digital business around strong products. For example, a manufacturer of expensive long-lived transportation products is building services that digitally diagnose and help to maintain those devices.
  - **Product innovation:** Some firms use digital transformation to connect their engineers more closely with global manufacturers or uses digital technology to connect designers closer to manufacturers, speeding the design-to-market cycle time.
  - **Partnership network:** Trusted relationships can deliver powerful new operating models. A firm is switching from a single value chain link to a value chain orchestrator. Partners cooperated in the project because of years of working together.
  - **Brand:** Companies with a strong brand are able to leverage it in related offerings. Through mobile web, social media and other digital initiatives, building additional points of contact with customers.
  - **Customer knowledge:** Companies have gathered more and more knowledge about customers. They can start envisioning the next step, monetizing this relationship to launch new products, enhance customer relationships or augment sales via customer-segmentation.
  - **Culture:** Some firms are able to use culture as a powerful asset. For some firms, entrepreneurial culture made digital transformation easier. Whereas unionized culture restricted change.
- Create a transformative vision

**Invest in digital initiatives and skills:** Transformation does not happen without investment. Business case may not be completely clear. It may be a series of low risk experiments. It often becomes a strategic bet that only senior executives can make. Digital transformation requires understanding the need for investment, managing risk, and making the changes necessary to capitalize on the change.

- Find the right skills
- Invest in initiatives that advance the vision

**Lead the change from the top:** Top-level vision rarely translates to local-level action unless reinforced through top-down communication and governance. Consistent engagement, backed with appropriate coordination, KPIs, and incentives, make the difficult process of transformation possible.

- **Engage the organization:** People can be a much bigger obstacle to successful digital transformation than any complex technology. Two main characteristics of communication in a digital world are making mobilizing the workforce easier:
  - Moving away from "cascading" information through traditional hierarchical channels toward enterprise-wide large scale communication: webcasts, internal social networks or PC-based video conferencing.
  - Moving away from a one-way "broadcasting" model of communication toward offering people in the organization the opportunity to engage in a real dialogue around the transformation: wikis, discussion forums, blogs and so on. Enterprise 2.0 tools are powerful tools to help mobilize and align the workforce towards digital objectives.
Successful organizations have not only created awareness through communication, but have increased the level of transparency and trust through this open dialogue.
- **Establish digital governance:** Bottom-up digital transformation is rarely successful. Opportunities from digital transformation require top-down ambition setting to put the organization in motion, coordination to turn disconnected or poorly considered digital investments into true platforms.
- **Ambition setting:** Once an organization has defined its transformative vision, leaders must translate that vision into a set of ambitions and targets that signal to executives and employees "what good looks like."
- **Coordinating mechanisms:** Successful companies in our study had strong leadership for digital initiatives. We found four models for coordinating digital transformation: central coordination, silo, hub and global. Central coordination is the most commonly used model, but no single model clearly outperforms others. Companies lacking effective digital coordination do not get the value possible from their digital transformation initiatives.
- **Monitoring progress through KPIs:** Leaders need to ensure that a transparent set of metrics and KPIs are in place to constantly monitor and review progress towards that ambition. We monitor our progress through a transparent scorecard where everyone can see a quantified assessment of our progress and take actions against it.

**The What and The How**

The digital transformation framework has many moving parts because much is required to drive a successful digital transformation.

- The What
- The How

The "what" and the "how" represent the digital maturity of an organization. They can be thought about as digital "Style" and "Substance." Many firms in our study are mature at only one, or neither.

**Digital maturity matrix**

- **Digital Beginners** are doing very little with advanced digital capabilities, although they have more traditional digital capabilities such as ERP, internet or e-mail. Many companies are in this quadrant by accident.
- **Digital Fashionistas** have implemented a large amount of sexy digital "stuff." Digital fashion items may look good together, but they may clash with other items, and they rarely generate synergies. Digital transformation strategy is not founded on real knowledge of how to proceed. We see many fashionistas in B2C businesses, where executives (especially the marketing units) believe they must move fast to keep up with the fast-moving world of consumer electronics, but do not necessarily have a clear vision for how the elements will collectively create value.
- **Digital Conservatives** understand the need for a strong unifying vision and for governance and internal engagement activities to ensure prudent investment management. They are typically skeptical of the value of new trends, sometimes to their detriment their careful approach may cause them to miss valuable opportunities.
- **Digirati** firms truly understand how to drive value from digital transformation. They combine a strong shared vision for transformation, careful governance and engagement, and sufficient investment in new opportunities. Through managing the "how" carefully, they develop a digital culture. Through managing the "what" sufficiently, they continuously advance the competitive advantage they draw from implementing digital transformation.

**How to assess your digital maturity? What is your digital maturity?**

- Digital intensity
- Transformation management intensity

Digital technology, which transformed the media industry, is now transforming the rest of the commercial world. In the way individuals work and collaborate, the way business processes are executed within and across organizational boundaries, or in the way the company understands and services customers, digital technology provides a wealth of opportunity to those willing to change. Globalization is dictating efficient integration through digital processes and collaborative tools. Employees and customers are starting to demand new ways of working.

1. Envision the digital future for your firm
- What assets will be valuable in a digitally-transformed business?
- How can you transform customer experience? Internal operations? Your business model?
- How can units work differently (and work together differently) in a more connected way?
2. Invest in digital transformation initiatives
- Are you getting all of the value out of your previous technology and platform investments in ERP, analytics, or collaboration tools? If not, what is necessary to get the foundations right?
- Where are the key investment areas that will maximize the contribution to the new vision?
- Can you de-risk some of the investments through experimentation and controlled testing?
- What skills are missing in your digital transformation initiatives? Do you need to hire new executives? Retrain front-line employees? Partner with another firm to gain capabilities?
3. Lead the change from the top
- How do you communicate the vision and engage the organization on a large scale? How do you monitor engagement?
- What process do you have in place to iterate the vision and strategy?
- How do you coordinate investments and activities across silos? What is the best organizational model to coordinate digital initiatives in parallel to the core business?
- What KPIs and metrics do you need to put in place to monitor the progress of your digital transformation towards your strategic goals?
- What mechanism do you use to make the necessary adjustments?

Digital transformation requires skills and influence that only senior leaders possess. Create a transformative vision that is clear and compelling to galvanize the organization. Mindfully consider what parts of your company should move (and why, and when) to make it implementable. Build digital maturity in two dimensions to increase your chances of success. Then take actions and monitor progress to turn your vision into reality.

##### Quotes

The resources-processes-values (RPV) framework offers explanations for why big companies succeed or fail to respond to disruptive innovations, [however] the emphasis in the theory has always been on nontechnology and little attention has been paid to the enabling role of technology in responding to disruptive innovations. [@Karimi2015]

(1) what are newspaper companies' key RPV factors that create first-order dynamic capabilities for responding to digital disruption?
(2) what is the role of such capabilities in building digital platform capabilities?
(3) do digital platform capabilities mediate the impact of first-order dynamic capabilities on the performance of newspaper companies?

Christensen framed disruption as a theory, [but, according to him,] disruptive innovation theory can be further improved by making definitions and measurements more precise, by refining the categories, and by clarifying the mechanism of causality. [@Karimi2015]

Three classes of resources are critical for enabling responses to digital disruption:

- Dedicated financial resources to fund innovation projects. Projects are often seen as unlikely to generate sizable profits, so companies may find it difficult to assign high priorities for those projects. [@Karimi2015]

Hypothesis 1: The greater the extent of the first-order dynamic capabilities, the higher a newspaper company's response performance will be in terms of digital revenue generated from all on-line sources. [@Karimi2015]
Hypothesis 2: The greater the extent of first-order dynamic capabilities, the higher a newspaper company's ability will be to build digital platform capabilities in response to digital disruption. [@Karimi2015]
Hypothesis 3: The greater the extent of digital platform capabilities, the higher a newspaper company's response performance will be in terms of number of digital non-core products. [@Karimi2015]
Hypothesis 4: The impact of first-order dynamic capabilities on response performance in terms of number of digital non-core products is mediated by a newspaper company's ability to build digital platform capabilities. [@Karimi2015]

Three research questions were examined in this study:
(1) What are newspaper companies' key RPV factors that create first-order dynamic capabilities for
responding to digital disruption?
(2) What is the role of such capabilities in building digital platform capabilities?
(3) Do digital platform capabilities mediate the impact of first-order dynamic capabilities?

#### Design Capital and Design Moves: the Logic of Digital Business Strategy [@Woodard2013]

Design capital:

- Option value
- Technical debt

Important contingencies:

- Resource munificence: organisational slack available
- Technical capability
- Ability to transfer the technical debt to the ecosystem

Design capital states and strategies:

- Option-constrained Design Capital: low option value & low technical debt.
  - if resource abundance, create design options
  - if resource scarcity, increase technical debt
- Debt-constrained Design Capital. high option value, high technical debt.
  - if resource scarcity, abandon design options
  - if resource abundant, reduce technical debt
- Low-quality Design Capital. low option value, high technical debt.
  - if resource scarcity, "pull the plug"
  - if resource abundance and high technical capability, reduce technical debt
  - if resource abundance and low technical capability, create design options
- High-quality Design Capital. high option value, low technical debt.
  - if resource scarcity and high ability to transfer technical debt to its ecosystem, increase technical debt
  - if resource scarcity and low ability to transfer technical debt to its ecosystem, abandon design options
  - if resource abundance, experimentation & entrepreneurial actions

##### Quotes

The market-changing potential of digital technologies is often wider than products, business processes, sales channels or supply chains. Entire business models are being reshaped and frequently overturned. There are many recent examples of organizations that have been unable to keep pace with the new digital reality. [@Hess2016]
Digital transformation is a complex issue that affects all segments within a company. Managers have to simultaneously balance the exploration and exploitation of their firms' resources and often lack clarity about the different options and elements they need to consider. [@Hess2016]
The Digital Transformation Framework (DTF) represents a holistic approach to the development of a company-wide digital transformation strategy. A digital transformation strategy identifies the four key dimensions of every digital transformation: Use of technologies, Changes in value creation, Structural changes, Financial aspects. [@Hess2016]

Most IT strategies treat technology in isolation, they often lack the transformational, business-centric orientation needed to realize the potential within a company's business model, products, processes and organizational structures. A digital transformation strategy signposts the way toward digital transformation and guides managers through the transformation process resulting from the integration and use of digital technologies and helps them navigate the complexity and ambiguity of identifying their own digital "sweet spots." [@Hess2016]

We regard size and value focus as crucial dimensions when investigating digital transformation. A firm's main product line will most likely play a crucial role in its digital transformation, because the integration of digital technologies into products is one of the key aspects of digital transformation. [@Hess2016]

To foster the transformation of ideas into new products and services, a dedicated innovation lab was established in 2012. P7S1 generates revenues from its digital products and services both indirectly via advertising and directly via paid content, the sales of virtual goods within online games, or through "freemium" models. Synergies between digital and traditional offerings are actively fostered. [@Hess2016]
P7S1's pure digital business unit, called "Digital & Adjacent, is led by a board member and is supported strongly by the CEO. The company has also launched a dedicated incubator ("ProSiebenSat.1 Accelerator"). [@Hess2016]

The newspaper publisher MittelBayerische has taken a pragmatic approach to digital technologies. It does not have a department focused on innovation; instead, it introduces established technologies that complement its existing product portfolio. Mittelbayerische believes that the competencies needed for digital transformation should come from within the company and has established a thorough personal development program that helps foster the necessary digital mindset and skill set among existing staff. [@Hess2016]

Ravensburger Interactive was launched in the 1990s, but was shut down later: activities in this area were too early and were unsuccessful. Ravensburger has entered the e-book and online gaming markets and has begun to develop complementary digital products that enrich its existing analog products. Although IT remains a support function for its core business activities, IT is regarded as a main driver of innovation within the company's digital business unit. Ravensburger has largely refrained from deploying digital technologies on non-content-related business segments and instead has focused on enriching analog products with digital content. Approximately 20% of Ravensburger's digital revenues are generated by these products. New digital products and services that are less closely related to the core business are organized in a dedicated subsidiary called "Ravensburger Digital", deliberately separated from the core business and physically separated from the headquarters to make it more appealing to applicants with different skill sets and to foster innovation. [@Hess2016]

Use of Technologies Dimension:

- Question 1: How Significant is Your Firm's IT to Achieving Strategic Goals?
  Some firms regard IT as an enabler of new business opportunities. Others, however, use IT to support and fulfill defined business requirements and improvements. Companies with an enabling perspective of IT must carefully monitor digital technologies
- Question 2: How Ambitious is Your Firm's Approach to New Digital Technologies?
  Conservative firms may adopt established and widely used technology solutions, while others may deploy new technology solutions at the early stages of their development. A more aggressive approach is to act as an innovator and create and introduce new technology solutions into markets. Firms should consider their existing technological competence, the extent of their technology spending and their size. However, not all media companies have the technological competencies required to become leaders,they should carefully assess their technological ambitions. [@Hess2016]

Changes in Value Creation Dimension: Changes in value creation relate mainly to the degree to which a company has already diversified its business into the digital world, how it plans to generate revenues from digital technologies and to its main business focus after a digital transformation. [@Hess2016]

- Question 3: How "Digital" is Your Interface to the Customer?
  Many firms want or need to exploit the possibilities of digital technologies and enter new business areas. This means considering how far away it should operate from its traditional core business. The optimal level of diversification is determined by a company's financial background and size. [@Hess2016]
- Question 4: How Will You Create Revenue from Future Business Operations?
  Finding new sources of revenue is an indispensable element of a digital transformation strategy. Some companies have tried to overcome constraints by extending their value-chain activities. [@Hess2016]
- Question 5: What Will Your Future Business Scope Be?
  Digital technologies may require media companies to rethink the scope of their businesses. Media companies generally maintain their focus on content creation and aggregation, whereas major assets of social media platforms derive from establishing connections between users and profiting from users' content to keep the platforms interesting. In contrast, there are media companies that deliberately shift their product and service portfolios to business areas that are less fundamentally affected by ongoing digital transformation. [@Hess2016]
- Question 6: Who is in Charge of the Digital Transformation Endeavor?
  The execution of such a strategy is often delegated to a senior manager. The CIO may also manage the transformation, which is typically the case if the focus is on business processes. [@Hess2016]
- Question 7: Do You Plan to Integrate New Operations into Existing Structures or Create Separate Entities?
  Decide whether to integrate new operations into their current operations or to organize them as distinct, separate units (perhaps as a newly formed subsidiary). Integration requires less extensive restructuring efforts, but it is important to examine whether synergies can be exploited. Organizing new digital activities in separate structures makes it easier to explicitly separate (physically and ideologically) old and new operations. Appropriate structures for new operations are more innovative and provide an increased level of flexibility. The greater the distance between digital transformation efforts and a firm's current core activities, the stronger the boundary between new and old operations should be. Digital transformation initiatives often involve significant innovation and change efforts, as well as a willingness to take risks, all of which may be difficult to accommodate within existing organizational structures. [@Hess2016]
- Question 8: What Types of Operational Changes Do You Expect?
  New technologies can significantly change the current products and services delivered to customers. Digital technologies can enable changes to business processes. Business processes can be classified as operational, support and management, but the typical focus of digital transformation initiatives is on operational processes. A company must define their processes and assess which of them will be affected by digital transformation. [@Hess2016]
- Question 9: Do You Need to Acquire New Competencies? If so, How Do You Plan to Acquire Them?
  Managers must carefully assess the firm's existing technology capabilities and identify the new competencies that will be needed. First option is to build on their current capabilities and acquire the required competencies. This approach typically takes time. Another option is to partner with other companies. This approach reduces the risk of failure. If the technological processes required for digital transformation are well structured and not overly complex, outsourcing these processes is another option. But, in the end, retaining the processes and knowledge required for digital transformation in-house means a company can be better positioned to gain a competitive advantage from future digital transformation initiatives. [@Hess2016]

Financial Aspects Dimension: Increasing financial pressure on the current core business might be the trigger that convinces management of the need for action. [@Hess2016]

- Question 10: How Strong is the Financial Pressure on Your Current Core Business?
  The willingness of top management to undertake the necessary efforts for, and accept the ensuing risks of, digital transformation endeavors often depends on the competitiveness of the current core business. Managers may not see the urgency for embarking on digital transformation. However, markets can change quickly and acting too late can be fatal. [@Hess2016]
- Question 11. How Will You Finance the Digital Transformation Endeavor?
  If a company is already financially struggling, its options for financing digital transformations will be severely limited. [@Hess2016]

For example, the automotive industry has introduced digitally enriched products (such as the "connected car") and new business models (such as free-floating car sharing) and an ongoing automation of product development and production processes. [@Hess2016]

The most important thing for managers charged with formulating their firms' digital transformation strategies is to know the right questions to ask. [@Hess2016]

#### Revamping Your Business Through Digital Transformation.

##### Dimensions

Start by rethinking four traditional assumptions that affect:

- how you relate to your customers
  ASSUMPTION 1: Our customers really value the human touch.
- how you run your operations
  ASSUMPTION 2: We've reached the limit of how far we can automate our operational processes.
- how you organize
  ASSUMPTION 3: Working as an integrated company will slow us down and stifle innovation.
- how you think about your business model.
  ASSUMPTION 4: The strategic assets that brought us success in the physical world will also be valuable in the digital environment.

Technologies:

- Smart mobile devices
- Collaboration platforms
- Big data analytics
- Robotics
- 3-D printing
- Augmented reality
- Internet of Things

##### Quotes

By using mobile devices, social media, analytics and the cloud, savvy companies are transforming the way they do business. For larger companies in more traditional industries, it's easy to think that digital transformation can wait. However, a follower strategy is wrong.

"Digital masters" differ not only in their capability but also in the clarity of their vision. Rather than incrementally adjusting current practices, they search for ways to use today's fast-moving technologies to transform the way they do business.

Start by rethinking four traditional assumptions that affect how you relate to your customers, how you run your operations, how you organize and even how you think about your business model.

ASSUMPTION 1: Our customers really value the human touch. Not all interactions with humans are actually valuable to customers. Digital innovation can combine no-touch (or limited-touch) service with high customer satisfaction. Some customers today favor self-service over personal interaction. For many young adults in their 20s and early 30s, interacting with a human service representative represents an inconvenience or an extra cost. However, transitioning to a direct-to-consumer model can be difficult: agents or dealers can rebel against what they perceive as a threat to their commissions. But, digital self-service environments can enhance the customer experience and also gather a rich stream of behavioral data that can help boost customer satisfaction and revenues.

ASSUMPTION 2: We've reached the limit of how far we can automate our operational processes. In the past, automation worked best for standardized repetitive tasks. It also allows you to radically redesign the way your company operates. Beyond just replacing workers, new technologies can augment their activities or free them to do more fulfilling work.

ASSUMPTION 3: Working as an integrated company will slow us down and stifle innovation. Pre-digital wisdom held that centralized companies, while slower to innovate, can be more efficient [and] argued that decentralized companies can be more responsive to local markets. This kind of mind-set forced managers to choose between two suboptimal structures. One of the paradoxes of digital technology is that standardization can actually lead to increased agility. Smart mobile devices, collaboration platforms and big data analytics wire organizations differently. Decentralized companies can have integration where it counts. Integrated systems and centralized processes offer benefits that go beyond efficiency and quality improvement and can also be useful platforms for innovation.

Ongoing streams of performance data open up the possibility of conducting controlled experiments on new ideas. Digital leaders have pursued this kind of A/B testing for years on-line and other companies are experimenting in physical settings. Sellers can adjust product bundling and pricing depending on circumstances. Technology are also changing the economics of manufacturing and making custom manufacturing more efficient.

ASSUMPTION 4: The strategic assets that brought us success in the physical world will also be valuable in the digital environment. Look for ways to leverage assets that you have and that fast-moving digital startups do not. Use these to establish and grow your digital advantage.

PagesJaunes, the French Yellow Pages company, saw that the assets related to printing and delivering books would have little use in the new model, but the company's knowledge of local businesses and the relationships its salespeople had with business owners were potentially critical assets going forward. By leveraging existing data and retraining the sales force, the company is attempting to reinvent itself in partnership with former competitor Google Inc. PagesJaunes began ramping up digital revenues in France faster than physical revenues were declining.

Data should be considered an asset class in its own right [and] analytics are useful for more than just optimizing business processes. Equally important is the role of assets in your business model. Traditional companies are taking a fresh look at how they can use the assets they own in new ways to participate in today's "sharing economy."

As digital technology reaches into every corner of the business world, it is creating a new playing field with new rules. digital has reshaped the expectations of customers, the way that employees collaborate and the business models that are possible. New technologies such as robotics, 3-D printing, augmented reality and the "Internet of Things" will soon lead to major business changes. Large traditional companies can out-compete fast-moving digital startups if they embrace the digital environment and find ways to make it theirs. Using pre-digital assumptions will not bring success in the digital world. When it comes to digital innovation, "you ainâ€™t seen nothinâ€™ yet"

#### The Business Models Investors Prefer [@PeterWeill2011]

##### Dimensions

Business model defined by: Asset type & Asset right.

The four asset types are:

- Financial assets
- Physical assets
- Intangible assets
- Human assets

The four asset rights are:

- Creators
- Distributors
- Landlords
- Brokers

##### Quotes

we found that in recent years, investors have favored business models focusing on licensing intellectual property.
Surprisingly, we found there is no universally accepted definition of the important concept of a business model. Our business model framework is based on defining the types of assets a company sells and the rights it grants customers to use those assets. We define four asset types and four ways companies manage asset rights to generate revenue.

The four asset types are:

- Financial assets, which include cash as well as securities like stocks, bonds and insurance policies
- Physical assets, which include durable items such as computers, as well as nondurable items such as food
- Intangible assets, which include intellectual property such as patents and copyrights, as well as other intangible assets like knowledge, goodwill and brand value
- Human assets, which include people's time and eï¬€ort. People of course cannot be legally bought and sold, but their time and knowledge can be "rented out" for a fee.

The four rights types sold:

- Creators, which sell ownership of products they have created
- Distributors, which sell ownership of products they bought
- Landlords, which sell only the right to use assets for a specified period of time
- Brokers, which receive a fee for matching buyers and sellers without ever taking ownership or custody of the product

Disney has dramatically shifted its business model over the last 20 years from renting physical assets like theme parks (to licensing intellectual property), with clear investor buy-in for this strategic shift. Disney stock outperformed the S&P 500 stock index over the last five years.

Manufacturers are generally highly valued by investors, with manufacturers who innovate even more highly valued. Financial and physical landlords were the poorest performing of the common business models, while IP landlords were the second-highest performing. Contractors (that primarily "rent out" human assets) had performance in the middle of the pack.

Innovative manufacturers - which we define as those who invest more than their industry average in research and development - are the top performers in the market. Apple is an example of an innovative manufacturer.
