#### Customer intimacy and other value disciplines [@Treacy1993]

##### Dimensions

A foundation book/article about value disciplines and how to use them to trade-off between strategic decision:

- Operational excellence: operations and execution.
  - Focus: Efficiency, streamlined operations, Supply Chain Management, no-frills, volume.
  - Value Prop: Reasonable quality at a very low price.
  - Key points:
    - Measuring systems are very important. Task oriented vision.
    - Extremely limited variation in product assortment.

##### Quotes
Value leaders in their industry redefined value for customers and built powerful, cohesive business systems that could deliver more of that value than competitors. They raised customers' expectations beyond the competition's reach. They changed what customers valued and how it was delivered, then boosted the level of value that customers expected [@Treacy1993].

In the past, customers judged the value of a product or service on the basis of some combination of quality and price. Today's customers, by contrast, have an expanded concept of value that includes convenience of purchase, after-sale service, dependability, and so on [@Treacy1993].

Companies that have taken leadership positions in their industries in the last decade typically have done so by narrowing their business focus, not broadening it, in line with one of three value disciplines: operational excellence, customer intimacy, or product leadership [@Treacy1993].

- Operational excellence means providing customers with reliable products or services at competitive prices and delivered with minimal diï¬ƒculty or inconvenience [@Treacy1993].
- Customer intimacy means segmenting and targeting markets precisely and then tailoring offerings to match exactly the demands of those niches [@Treacy1993].
- Product leadership means offering customers leading-edge products and services that consistently enhance the customer's use [@Treacy1993].

Companies that push the boundaries of one value discipline while meeting industry standards in the other two gain such a lead that competitors find it hard to catch up. Leaders have aligned their entire operating model-that is, the company's culture, business processes, management systems, and computer platforms to serve one value discipline [@Treacy1993].

**Customer Intimacy**

**Product Leadership**

Vistakon can move fast and take risks because it is organized like a small, entrepreneurial company [@Treacy1993].

**Customers types**

**Sustaining the Lead**

Many companies falter simply because they lose sight of their value discipline. Reacting to competitive pressures, they pursue initiatives that are inconsistent with the company's value discipline. They are diverting energy and resources away from advancing their operating model [@Treacy1993].

#### How Competitive Forces Shape Strategy [@Porter1979]

##### Dimensions

**Threat of entry**

Factors hindering new entrants:

1. Product differentiation
1. Cost disadvantages independent of size: experience, location, specific resources
1. Concentration: Economies of scale
1. Access to distribution channels
1. Capital requirements
1. Government policy

**Powerful suppliers & buyers**

Factor:
- Concentration of buyer/seller
- Differentiation of products bought/sold
- Buyer/seller is a Potential entrant
- Non-core to the buyer/seller
- High Marginal Cost to the buyer

**Substitute products**

Substitute products that deserve the most attention strategically are those that:

- are subject to trends improving their price-performance trade-off with the industry's product
- are produced by industries earning high profits.

**Jockeying for position**

- Concentration: Numerous or similarly sized rivals.
- Low growth of industry
- No differentiation or switching costs.
- High fixed costs or exit barriers.
- Nemesis: rivals having differing "personalities".

**Formulation of Strategy**

- Positioning the company
- Influencing the balance
- Exploiting industry change

##### Quotes

The essence of strategy formulation is coping with competition. Yet it is easy to view competition too narrowly and too pessimistically. While one sometimes hears executives complaining to the contrary, intense competition in an industry is neither coincidence nor bad luck [@Porter1979].

Competition is not manifested only in the other players. Competition in an industry is rooted in its underlying economics, and competitive forces exist that go well beyond the established combatants in a particular industry. Customers, suppliers, potential entrants, and substitute products are all competitors that may be more or less prominent or active depending on the industry. Knowledge of these underlying sources of competitive pressure provides the groundwork for a strategic agenda of action [@Porter1979].

The strongest competitive force or forces determine the profitability of an industry and so are of greatest importance in strategy formulation. Even a company with a strong position in an industry unthreatened by potential entrants will earn low returns if it faces a superior or a lower-cost substitute product. Every industry has an underlying structure, or a set of fundamental economic and technical characteristics, that gives rise to these competitive forces [@Porter1979].

**Formulation of Strategy**

Once having assessed the forces affecting competition in an industry and their underlying causes, the corporate strategist can identify the company's strengths and weaknesses. Then the strategist can devise a plan of action that may include:
- positioning the company so that its capabilities provide the best defense against the competitive force
- influencing the balance of the forces through strategic moves, thereby improving the company's position
- anticipating shifts in the factors underlying the forces and responding to them

**Positioning the company**

The first approach takes the structure of the industry as given and matches the company's strengths and weaknesses to it. Strategy can be viewed as building defenses against the competitive forces or as finding positions in the industry where the forces are weakest. Knowledge of the company's capabilities and of the causes of the competitive forces will highlight the areas where the company should confront competition and where avoid it. If the company is a low-cost producer, it may choose to confront powerful buyers while it takes care to sell them only products not vulnerable to competition from substitutes.

**Influencing the balance**

When dealing with the forces that drive industry competition, a company can devise a strategy that takes the offensive. This posture is designed to do more than merely cope with the forces themselves; it is meant to alter their causes. Innovations in marketing can raise brand identification or otherwise differentiate the product. Capital investments in large-scale facilities or vertical integration affect entry barriers. The balance of forces is partly a result of external factors and partly in the company's control.

**Exploiting industry change**

Industry evolution is important strategically because evolution, of course, brings with it changes in the sources of competition. In the familiar product life-cycle pattern, for example, growth rates change, product differentiation is said to decline as the business becomes more mature, and the companies tend to integrate vertically. These trends are not so important in themselves; what is critical is whether they affect the sources of competition.

##### Quotes

The long term fluctuations that we call long waves result of successive couplings and decouplings of two spheres of the system: the techno-economic and the socio-institutional. When a good coupling is achieved between those two spheres, there is a long period of two or three decades of stable growth, perceived as times of prosperity. When a decoupling occurs, it results in equally long periods of irregular growth, recessions and depressions, perceived as bad times.

With each technological revolution, it takes decades to reestablish the coherence of the total system. But, once the good match is achieved, a period of prosperity ensues.

**UNDERSTANDING TECHNOLOGY AND ITS MODE OF EVOLUTION**

The invention of a new product occurs within the techno-scientific sphere. An innovation is when this invention becomes an economic fact. The first commercial introduction of an innovation transfers it into the techno-economic sphere. The fact with the most far-reaching social consequences is the process of massive adoption.

Incremental innovations are successive improvements upon existing products and processes. The course of incremental change is relatively predictable. _A radical innovation, by contrast, is the introduction of a truly new product or process. They can be introduced at any point in time cutting short the life cycle of the products or processes they substitute._

Every radically new product, when it is first introduced, is relatively primitive. Gradually, it consolidates a position in the market. Then, there is a sort of take-off for a period of successive incremental improvements. At last, the technology reaches maturity. There is a high likelihood that, at maturity, the product will be replaced by another. Depending on the type of product, this cycle can last months, years or decades.

**Technological systems as paths for radical innovations**

_"Technological systems" are constellations of innovations, technically and economically interrelated and are related to "generic technologies"_, whose natural trajectory of evolution encompasses that of a whole set of interconnected radical innovations.

From the vantage point of a technological system, then, there is a logic, which joins successive interrelated radical innovations in a common natural trajectory. The widespread impact of a new technological system stems from the "wide adaptability" of the contributing innovations and from their multiple character. Yet technology systems, in a manner similar to individual technologies, eventually exhaust their potential for further growth and improvement. So, at the level of technology systems, we re-encounter the same phenomena of continuity and discontinuity in evolution.

**Self-reinforced processes of growth and exhaustion**

The process of substitution is not one of eradication but of a slow and painful change in the proportions of the new against the old. However, the end result is a radical change in the structures involved.

The deployment of each technology system involves several interconnected processes of change :

1. The development of surrounding services
2. The "cultural" adaptation
3. The setting up of the institutional facilitators

_The adaptations that occur around a particular system generate conditions that strongly favor innovations that are compatible with -or can be fit into- the systems already in place. Externalities reduce the expenses of introducing an innovation and convincing users. Due to more and more powerful externalities, the greater the development of a system, the shorter the life cycle of each radical innovation within it._ The life cycle of the radical innovations that appear in the later stages of the development of a system is usually much shorter than that of the earlier ones.

**Technological revolutions as rejuvenation of all systems**

_In the early 1970's, the automobile industry had reached maturity. Automobiles had become "commodities" and the future was seen as complete standardization. Few could foresee what happened. Japanese industry developed a distinctly different way of organizing production and markets. The industry was completely renewed and set on a different and very dynamic trajectory of incremental innovation._

Maturity does not inevitably end in the marginalization of a system, but when many inter-related systems tend to come to maturity more or less simultaneously, a general solution appears in the form of a technological revolution. About every fifty or sixty years, there is the diffusion of a new set of generic technologies, capable of rejuvenating and transforming practically all existing industries.

Schumpeter and others have emphasized the powerfully dynamic nature of each of those great waves. Society has recognized their overarching influence by referring to the periods as the Industrial Revolution, the Railway Era, the Age of Electricity and the Age of the Automobile.

**TECHNO-ECONOMIC PARADIGMS AS COMMON SENSE MODELS TRANSFORMING THE PRODUCTIVE SPHERE**

**A cheap input as vehicle of diffusion**

Diffusion in the early phase demands a simple vehicle of propagation : long-term cost effectiveness provided by a "key factor". _Each revolution has its key factor :_

- Railways & the steam engine: cheap coal
- Electricity, heavy chemistry and heavy civil engineering: cheap steel
- Asphalt roads and automobiles: cheap petroleum
- Information & telecommunications: cheap electronic chips.

In each case, the "key factor" steers engineering and investment decisions towards its intensive use.

**Diffusion is self-reinforced**

New technologies diffuses because of 2 reasons :
- the prevailing technologies are exhausted and their exclusion mechanisms are weakened.
- there are obvious changes in the relative cost structure, which are seen to be permanent.

The process of switching over becomes self-reinforcing through several feedback loops. The greater the diffusion of its applications, the greater the demand for the "key factor" which leads to economies of scale and lower costs, which widens the range of applications.

**A new paradigm as a quantum jump in potential productivity for all**

_Each technological revolution generates also a wave of organizational innovation._ The principles of mass production, which achieved the continuous flow of automobiles, diffused across all sectors. _The organizational structure based on many layers, functional departments and divisions became the model for effectiveness and efficiency. But today, the adaptability of the Japanese managerial network has been found to be one of the most appropriate forms of organization to take advantage of the flexibility of information technology_ and is diffusing in more and more sectors.

So each technological revolution brings at the same time a set of new industries, with a low cost input at the core, and a set of generic all-pervasive technologies and organizational principles capable of renewing all the other productive activities.

**Difficult assimilation: The shaping of a paradigm takes decades**

The paradigm change can take decades. The construction and propagation of a paradigm is difficult. The pioneers can go a long way in impressive growth of production and profits. _One of the areas of strong resistance to diffusion is found in the leadership of established firms. It is difficult to believe that the "normal" way of doing things has become old style and ineffective._

_Those who had vast experience in applying the old principles find themselves forced to learn a new way of thinking and behaving. Yet, this internal resistance tends to be overcome by the threat to profits._ Each technological revolution must make its way in a world fully adapted to the requirements of the previous techno-economic paradigm.

**STRUCTURAL CHANGE IN THE ECONOMY AND SOCIO-INSTITUTIONAL INERTIA**

The existing institutions take a long time to grasp the transformations taking place. The new technologies are very visible indeed, but their consequences take a long time to reach public awareness.

It is then that the social pressure for change is clearly felt.  Thus, long wave transitions are processes of "creative destruction".

Last time around, to overcome the great depression of the 1930's, it was necessary to surmount the prevailing notions about the superiority of free market mechanisms and accept the establishment of massive and systematic State intervention in the economy, generally following Keynesian principles. Today, almost every one of these innovations, relatively effective and widely accepted until the 1970's, is under question.

Long waves are related to the internal coherence of the system. About every half century, the techno-economic sphere experiences changes of paradigm which require equally vast changes in the socio-institutional framework. Yet, the changes in the economy take place at a much faster pace than in social institutions. The resulting mismatch brings about the "bad times" (two to three decades). When structural coherence is regained, there are two or three decades of "good times".

**TECHNO-ORGANISATIONAL PARADIGMS AS GUIDELINES FOR CHANGE IN THE SOCIO-INSTITUTIONAL SPHERE**

**The wide space of the possible**

For the previous paradigm, we can recognize at least four major modes of growth: Keynesian democracy, Fascism, Socialism and, in the Third World, "State Developmentalism". They all share certain common features :

- Central government, engaged in the economy
- State as the main agent of redistribution of wealth
- "Homogeneity" of consumption styles within the Nation-State
- Central representation of the provinces
- "Mass" character of political parties
- Government by one or very few main political parties
- Separation of political leadership from "technical" management

One can now also see a parallel between the typical forms of organization of the traditional big corporations and that of hospitals, universities, ministries and governments in general.

As the new paradigm unfolds in the economy, its logic propagates towards all of society, modifying the common sense criteria that guide all sorts of organizations and eventually resulting in maximum social synergy.

**The notion of a paradigm can be understood on three levels**

_Each techno-economic paradigm is constructed on three inter-related levels:_

- New technology systems : microelectronics, software & telecommunications
- New "best practice" model : flexible organizational model
- New "common sense" principles for organizational & institutional design : decentralization, networking, continuous improvement, users/stakeholders involvement in the organization

The variety of forms of adoption for the new paradigm is immense. And, at each transition, the traditional "left-right" political divide is made more complex by the appearance -in each group- of another divide between the "old paradigm" and the "new paradigm" ideas.

_What the paradigm provides is not the goals but the forms and the technical and organizational tools._ The space for institutional creativity is very wide. This means that each crisis is a point of determination in history.

Embracing the new paradigm means facing the future with a commitment to the construction of a framework capable of making best social use of the new wealth creating potential and a willingness to assimilate change and promote creativity at all levels and in all spheres.

_Historically these transition processes have been long and difficult, with a very high cost in human suffering._ It is to be hoped that a better understanding of the nature of the transformation could help to alleviate the social cost and to quicken the success of the task of institutional experimentation.

#### Strategic principles for competing in the digital age [@Hirt2014]

Opportunities and threats:

- **Enhancing interactions** among customers, suppliers, stakeholders, and employees
- **Improving management decisions** as algorithms crunch big data from social technologies or the Internet of Things
- **Enabling new business or operating models**, such as peer-to-peer product innovation or customer service

7 forces at work:

1. New pressure on prices and margins
1. Competitors emerge from unexpected places
1. Winner-takes-all dynamics
1. Plug-and-play business models
1. Growing talent mismatches
1. Converging global supply and demand
1. Relentlessly evolving business models at higher velocity

Managing the strategic challenges: Six big decisions

- Decision 1: Buy or sell businesses in your portfolio?
- Decision 2: Lead your customers or follow them?
- Decision 3: Cooperate or compete with new attackers? (link with @Iansiti2014: GE's doing more partnerships)
- Decision 4: Diversify or double down on digital initiatives? (_potential_ link with @Woodard2013: Augment the design capital by augmenting the options or diminish the technical debt)
- Decision 5: Keep digital businesses separate or integrate them with current nondigital ones? (link with @Karimi2015: depending on the characteristics (size, existing assets, agility needed, risk aversion...), some have integrated or not the digital business unit)
- Decision 6: Delegate or own the digital agenda?

**Introduction**

The new world of the Exponential Organization or ExO is a place where neither age nor size nor reputation nor even current sales guarantee that you will be around tomorrow. The lifespan of a company is going to get even shorter in the years to come as giant corporations aren't just forced to compete with, but are annihilated -seemingly overnight- by a new breed of companies that harnesses the power of exponential technologies [@VanGeest2014].

Those enterprises that don't jump aboard soon will be left on the ash heap of history joining Iridium, Kodak, Polaroid, Philco, Blockbuster, Nokia and a host of other once-great, industry-dominant corporations unable to adapt to rapid technological change [@VanGeest2014].

**Chapter One: Illuminated by Information**

**Chapter Two: A Tale of Two Companies**

**Chapter Three: The Exponential Organization**

What else can be information-enabled?
Two fundamental drivers enable ExOs:
Some aspect of the company's product has been information-enabled and thus, following Moore's Law, thanks to the fact that information is essentially liquid, major business functions can be transferred outside of the organization- to users, fans, partners or the general public. Massive Transformative Purpose (MTP) Exponential Organizations, almost by definition, think BIG. If a company thinks small, it is unlikely to pursue a business strategy that will achieve rapid growth [@VanGeest2014].

Five external characteristics that define an Exponential Organization, for which the acronym SCALE is used:

**Chapter Four: Inside the Exponential Organization**

**Chapter Five: Implications of Exponential Organizations**

This is perhaps the best time in the history of business to build a new enterprise. Traditional risk areas have been mitigated like never before [@VanGeest2014]:

- Technology risk: Will it work? The technology risk that was once enormous (particularly software) has been reduced over the last twenty years by 150x. Most of the remaining risks concerns mere scalability issues [@VanGeest2014].
- Market risk: Will people buy the product? Starting in the 2000s, startups could test the market like never before by leveraging A/B testing, Google AdWords campaigns, social media and landing pages. Now an idea could be partially validated before product engineering even began.  - Execution risk: Is the team able to function and pivot as needed? Execution risk remains
the only real issue in building a company [@VanGeest2014].

It takes more than seven years, on average, before a "liquidity event." Companies with well-educated thirty-something co-founders who have history together tend to be most successful. The idea of "big pivots" is an outlier, most Unicorns stick to their original vision. The challenge facing every startup lies in discovering how to de-risk each of these areas and, in the process, find a business model in the chosen problem space [@VanGeest2014].

**Ask Key Questions Periodically**
1. Who is your customer?
2. Which customer problem are you solving?
3. What is your solution and _does it improve the status quo by at least 10x?_
4. How will you market the product or service?
5. How are you selling the product or service?
6. How do you turn customers into advocates using viral effects and Net Promoter Scores to _drive down the marginal cost of demand?_
7. How will you scale your customer segment?
8. How will you _drive the marginal cost of supply towards zero?_

**Building and Maintaining a Platform**
Four steps needed to build a successful platform (as opposed to a successful product):
1. Identify a pain point or use case for a consumer [@VanGeest2014].
2. Identify a core value unit or social object in any interaction between a producer and consumer. Pictures, jokes, advice, reviews, information: many
people will be both producers and consumers [@VanGeest2014].
3. Design a way to facilitate that interaction. Build it as a small prototype that you can curate yourself [@VanGeest2014].
4. Determine how to build a network around your interaction. ExOs follow four steps in terms of data and APIs [@VanGeest2014]:
  1. Gather: The algorithmic process starts with harnessing data, which is gathered via sensors, people, or imported from public datasets.
  2. Organize: The next step is to organize the data. This is known as ETL (extract, transform and load).
  3. Apply: Once the data is accessible, algorithms such as machine or deep learning extract insights, identify trends and tune new algorithms. These are realized via tools such as Hadoop and Pivotal, or even (open source) deep learning algorithms like DeepMind or Skymind.
  4. Expose: The final step is exposing the data in the form of an open platform. Open data and APIs can be used such that an ExO's community develops valuable services, new functionalities and innovations layered on top of the platform by remixing published data with their own.

With established companies, the solution is inevitably customized: you must start with what already exists and build from there. There is no universal template for "going exponential" [@VanGeest2014].

**Chapter Eight: ExOs for Large Organizations**

**Issues facing large organizations:** Most focus and attention is internal, not external. Emphasis tends to be on technologies with existing expertise; converging technologies or adjacencies tend to be ignored and breakthrough thinking is punished. Reliance on innovation from inside rather than outside [@VanGeest2014].

Transformation isn't easy, a big company is like a supertanker: it takes a long time to turn. There are many examples of big companies morphing: Nokia used to be a tire company, Samsung was once a trading company and Intel got its start in memory chips. GE, a company with a long and distinguished history, has repeatedly reinvented itself [@VanGeest2014].

Four strategies for large organizations to deploy in an accelerating business world

**Partner with, invest in or acquire ExOs.** [@VanGeest2014]
Large companies must identify and track disruptive ExOs with the aim of observing, partnering with, investing in and/ or acquiring them. The real question then is not whether to acquire an ExO, but when to partner with one, when to invest in one and when to acquire it. A corporation should look to create an internal ExO when [@VanGeest2014]:

- An opportunity is one to two adjacencies away from the company's core business- perhaps a different business model, buyer, user or go-to market.
- Urgency is low- there is still time until the market's inflection point.
- The company is able to hire the necessary talent.

Acquisition is usually the most appropriate path when a market is strategically imperative to "own" but you face the following obstacles [@VanGeest2014]:

- It is difficult to hire the right talent.
- The market inflection point is upon you.
- The opportunity is too far removed (3 + adjacencies) from the corporation's prevailing model.

**Disrupt[ X].** [@VanGeest2014]
Third strategy is to leverage disruptive technologies themselves: this is a lot harder than it looks, given that the organizational structures of established companies exist to suppress disruptive influences [@VanGeest2014].

Move change-makers in your enterprise to the edges of the organization and unleash them as ExOs to disrupt other markets [@VanGeest2014].

Hire both internal and external Black Ops teams and have them establish startups with a combined goal of defeating one another and disrupting the mother ship [@VanGeest2014].

Start an internal accelerating technologies lab, leveraging core competencies and aiming for moonshot innovations at a budget price [@VanGeest2014].

Partner with Accelerators, Incubators and Hackerspaces. Find an incubator or an accelerator that is a good fit for your organization [@VanGeest2014].

**Chapter Ten: The Exponential Executive**
The ExO concept, the new organizing principle for the information age, is just a few years old and thus still evolving into its final form. C-Level executives are going to find themselves under enormous pressure to either "go exponential" or deal with the threat presented by new, exponential competitors. This chapter answers the following questions [@VanGeest2014]:

- Which technologies will have the most impact on the C-Suite?
- What new organizational developments must an Exponential Executive track and be ready for?
- What questions and issues will the ExO Executive face in the next five to ten years as a result of this collective and accelerating change?

**In brief**


Most sectors across the economy are less than 15 percent as digitized as the leading sectors [@Manyika2015].

Currently, there are three big areas of potential : online talent platforms, big data analytics, and the Internet of Things [@Manyika2015].

**Executive summary**

There is a persistent gap between the digital "haves" and "have-mores". True disruptors are even gaining the ability to reshape industries to their own advantage. Also, the workers with the most sophisticated digital skills are the "have-mores" [@Manyika2015].

Despite a rush of adoption, most sectors have barely closed the gap over the past decade. Companies will redefine many roles, and the rate of job displacement could accelerate sharply. It needs more than a business-as-usual approach to skills development [@Manyika2015].

Digitization, like electricity, is a general-purpose technology that underpins a huge share of economic activity beyond the sector that supplies it [@Manyika2015].

**THE DIGITAL FRONTIER IS RAPIDLY EVOLVING, AND THOSE AT THE FOREFRONT CAPTURE DISPROPORTIONATE REWARDS**

**SOME INDUSTRIES AND COMPANIES ARE MORE DIGITIZED THAN OTHERS**

The real value lies in combining digital assets and capabilities with ingenuity [@Manyika2015].

The MGI Industry Digitization Index examines sectors across the economy through the lens of digital assets, digital usage, and digital workers by considering several indicators:

- Spending on computers, software & telecom, share of assets such as robots and connected cars
- Usage of digital payments, digital marketing, social technologies and CRM
- Share of task description with digital technologies and digital spending and assets per worker [@Manyika2015].

The index highlights where there is room for growth in digital capabilities [@Manyika2015].

Lagging sectors could experience catch-up growth if the long tail of smaller and less digitized businesses begins to close the gap with leading companies [@Manyika2015].

The "have-mores" continue to push the boundaries of digitization, particularly in terms of augmenting what their workers do, while everyone else scrambles to keep up with them [@Manyika2015].

Why some sectors went digital sooner ? Four factors shape those outcomes:

- Firm size : larger firms are more digitized
- Complexity of operations: firms with long supply chains are more digitized
- Knowledge intensity: firms with a large share of highly educated workers are more digitized
- Threat of competition : the actual degree of competition is not a factor, but the prospect of competition is, e.g when a sector is becoming deregulated [@Manyika2015].

**Digital assets determine competitive advantage**

**Value chains break apart, creating openings for specialization and new competitors**

**Low marginal costs and network effects create hyperscale advantages**

**Industry boundaries become blurred**

**DIGITIZATION CREATES HUGE BENEFITS FOR CONSUMERS AND MORE COMPLEX EFFECTS ON GROWTH AND EMPLOYMENT**

Consumers have captured a huge range of benefits, but there are negative implications for employment and wages [@Manyika2015].

**Digitization produces significant benefits to consumers and society**

Digitization has contributed to rapid GDP and productivity growth in the past, but recent gains are blurred [@Manyika2015].

In the late 1980s, digital adoption grew in many sectors, and productivity growth soon followed, increasing annually by 1.6 percent, nearly 2.5 times as fast as in the preceding 20 years. This was reflect in GDP, which rose nearly 4 percent per year [@Manyika2015].

But after 2005, these effects vanish from the measured statistics. Total productivity growth has fallen by two-thirds since 2005, while real GDP growth has averaged about 2 percent per year [@Manyika2015].

Also, it can take several years for large firms (and whole sectors) to make the changes necessary to capture the full benefits of digital investments [@Manyika2015].

**Digitization polarizes the labor market, but can help to address some of its inefficiencies**

BY 2025, THREE EFFECTS OF DIGITIZATION ALONE COULD BOOST GDP BY UP TO \$2.2 TRILLION-BUT THE POSSIBILITIES ARE MUCH WIDER [@Manyika2015].

**AUTOMATION COULD REDEFINE MANY OCCUPATIONS AND ACCELERATE HISTORICAL RATES OF MIDDLE-SKILL JOB DISPLACEMENT**

**COMPANIES HAVE TO ADAPT TO SURVIVE IN THE DIGITAL ECONOMY**

Take advantage of new innovation models. Replace closed and rigid R&D operations with more open processes. Users, too, can be engaged [@Manyika2015].

**POLICY CHALLENGES INCLUDE BUILDING PHYSICAL AND REGULATORY INFRASTRUCTURE AS WELL AS HELPING THE WORKFORCE TRANSITION**

Governments have a dual challenge. In addition to setting policy, they have significant potential to digitize their own operations [@Manyika2015].

Encourage participation. Encouraging participation is about encouraging digital literacy and encouraging adoption of digital tools [@Manyika2015].

Set the rules of the game, but be prepared to learn and adapt. policy framework will require attention to evolving issues such as privacy. Policy making for a more digital economy requires a new mindset. Ongoing innovation calls for a test-and-learn approach to policy [@Manyika2015].

Help individuals navigate the transition. Policy makers cannot fend off automation, but they can support those who are affected. The first major area for action is skills development. Another major focus area is worker protections, by considering how to modernize the system for delivering benefits [@Manyika2015].

**Execution challenges:**

Successful digital transformations used a common set of elements:
- diagnose the potential value of existing corporate assets
- build a transformative vision for the future
- invest in skills and initiatives to make the vision a reality

These elements work together in an iterative approach, constantly communicating and listening to re-envision and further implement new types of digital transformation. It's an iterative three-step process:

1. Envision the digital future for your firm.
2. Invest in digital initiatives and skills.
3. Lead the change from the top.

**Coordinating mechanisms:** Successful companies in our study had strong leadership for digital initiatives. We found four models for coordinating digital transformation: central coordination, silo, hub and global. Central coordination is the most commonly used model, but no single model clearly outperforms others. Companies lacking effective digital coordination do not get the value possible from their digital transformation initiatives [@Westerman2011].

**The What and The How**

The digital transformation framework has many moving parts because much is required to drive a successful digital transformation [@Westerman2011].

- The What
- The How

The "what" and the "how" represent the digital maturity of an organization. They can be thought about as digital "Style" and "Substance." Many firms in our study are mature at only one, or neither [@Westerman2011].

**Digital maturity matrix**

**Digital Beginners** are doing very little with advanced digital capabilities, although they have more traditional digital capabilities such as ERP, internet or e-mail. Many companies are in this quadrant by accident [@Westerman2011].

**Digital Fashionistas** have implemented a large amount of sexy digital "stuff." Digital fashion items may look good together, but they may clash with other items, and they rarely generate synergies. Digital transformation strategy is not founded on real knowledge of how to proceed. We see many fashionistas in B2C businesses, where executives (especially the marketing units) believe they must move fast to keep up with the fast-moving world of consumer electronics, but do not necessarily have a clear vision for how the elements will collectively create value [@Westerman2011].

**Digital Conservatives** understand the need for a strong unifying vision and for governance and internal engagement activities to ensure prudent investment management. They are typically skeptical of the value of new trends, sometimes to their detriment their careful approach may cause them to miss valuable opportunities [@Westerman2011].

**Digirati** firms truly understand how to drive value from digital transformation. They combine a strong shared vision for transformation, careful governance and engagement, and sufficient investment in new opportunities. Through managing the "how" carefully, they develop a digital culture. Through managing the "what" sufficiently, they continuously advance the competitive advantage they draw from implementing digital transformation [@Westerman2011].

**How to assess your digital maturity? What is your digital maturity?**

- Digital intensity
- Transformation management intensity

Digital technology, which transformed the media industry, is now transforming the rest of the commercial world. In the way individuals work and collaborate, the way business processes are executed within and across organizational boundaries, or in the way the company understands and services customers, digital technology provides a wealth of opportunity to those willing to change. Globalization is dictating efficient integration through digital processes and collaborative tools. Employees and customers are starting to demand new ways of working [@Westerman2011].

1. Envision the digital future for your firm
- What assets will be valuable in a digitally-transformed business?
- How can you transform customer experience? Internal operations? Your business model?
- How can units work differently (and work together differently) in a more connected way?
2. Invest in digital transformation initiatives
- Are you getting all of the value out of your previous technology and platform investments in ERP, analytics, or collaboration tools? If not, what is necessary to get the foundations right?
- Where are the key investment areas that will maximize the contribution to the new vision?
- Can you de-risk some of the investments through experimentation and controlled testing?
- What skills are missing in your digital transformation initiatives? Do you need to hire new executives? Retrain front-line employees? Partner with another firm to gain capabilities?
3. Lead the change from the top
- How do you communicate the vision and engage the organization on a large scale? How do you monitor engagement?
- What process do you have in place to iterate the vision and strategy?
- How do you coordinate investments and activities across silos? What is the best organizational model to coordinate digital initiatives in parallel to the core business?
- What KPIs and metrics do you need to put in place to monitor the progress of your digital transformation towards your strategic goals?
- What mechanism do you use to make the necessary adjustments?

Digital transformation requires skills and influence that only senior leaders possess. Create a transformative vision that is clear and compelling to galvanize the organization. Mindfully consider what parts of your company should move (and why, and when) to make it implementable. Build digital maturity in two dimensions to increase your chances of success. Then take actions and monitor progress to turn your vision into reality [@Westerman2011].

  - Staged allocation of resources (SAR)
  - Autonomous growth group (ACG)
- Values: They are the primary building-blocks for culture, which is the pattern of shared values, norms, and practices that distinguishes one organization from another.
  - Innovative culture (IC)
  - Common language (CL)

##### Quotes

The resources-processes-values (RPV) framework offers explanations for why big companies succeed or fail to respond to disruptive innovations, [however] the emphasis in the theory has always been on nontechnology and little attention has been paid to the enabling role of technology in responding to disruptive innovations [@Karimi2015].

(1) what are newspaper companies' key RPV factors that create first-order dynamic capabilities for responding to digital disruption?
(2) what is the role of such capabilities in building digital platform capabilities?
(3) do digital platform capabilities mediate the impact of first-order dynamic capabilities on the performance of newspaper companies?

Christensen framed disruption as a theory, [but, according to him,] disruptive innovation theory can be further improved by making definitions and measurements more precise, by refining the categories, and by clarifying the mechanism of causality [@Karimi2015].

Three classes of resources are critical for enabling responses to digital disruption:

- Dedicated financial resources to fund innovation projects. Projects are often seen as unlikely to generate sizable profits, so companies may find it difficult to assign high priorities for those projects [@Karimi2015].

Hypothesis 1: The greater the extent of the first-order dynamic capabilities, the higher a newspaper company's response performance will be in terms of digital revenue generated from all on-line sources [@Karimi2015].
Hypothesis 2: The greater the extent of first-order dynamic capabilities, the higher a newspaper company's ability will be to build digital platform capabilities in response to digital disruption [@Karimi2015].
Hypothesis 3: The greater the extent of digital platform capabilities, the higher a newspaper company's response performance will be in terms of number of digital non-core products [@Karimi2015].
Hypothesis 4: The impact of first-order dynamic capabilities on response performance in terms of number of digital non-core products is mediated by a newspaper company's ability to build digital platform capabilities [@Karimi2015].

Three research questions were examined in this study:
(1) What are newspaper companies' key RPV factors that create first-order dynamic capabilities for
responding to digital disruption?
(2) What is the role of such capabilities in building digital platform capabilities?
(3) Do digital platform capabilities mediate the impact of first-order dynamic capabilities?

#### Design Capital and Design Moves: the Logic of Digital Business Strategy [@Woodard2013]

Design capital:

- Option value
- Technical debt

Important contingencies:

- Resource munificence: organisational slack available
- Technical capability
- Ability to transfer the technical debt to the ecosystem

Design capital states and strategies:

- Option-constrained Design Capital: low option value & low technical debt.
  - if resource abundance, create design options
  - if resource scarcity, increase technical debt
- Debt-constrained Design Capital. high option value, high technical debt.
  - if resource scarcity, abandon design options
  - if resource abundant, reduce technical debt
- Low-quality Design Capital. low option value, high technical debt.
  - if resource scarcity, "pull the plug"
  - if resource abundance and high technical capability, reduce technical debt
  - if resource abundance and low technical capability, create design options
- High-quality Design Capital. high option value, low technical debt.
  - if resource scarcity and high ability to transfer technical debt to its ecosystem, increase technical debt
  - if resource scarcity and low ability to transfer technical debt to its ecosystem, abandon design options
  - if resource abundance, experimentation & entrepreneurial actions

##### Quotes

The market-changing potential of digital technologies is often wider than products, business processes, sales channels or supply chains. Entire business models are being reshaped and frequently overturned. There are many recent examples of organizations that have been unable to keep pace with the new digital reality [@Hess2016].

Digital transformation is a complex issue that affects all segments within a company. Managers have to simultaneously balance the exploration and exploitation of their firms' resources and often lack clarity about the different options and elements they need to consider [@Hess2016].

The Digital Transformation Framework (DTF) represents a holistic approach to the development of a company-wide digital transformation strategy. A digital transformation strategy identifies the four key dimensions of every digital transformation: Use of technologies, Changes in value creation, Structural changes, Financial aspects [@Hess2016].

We regard size and value focus as crucial dimensions when investigating digital transformation. A firm's main product line will most likely play a crucial role in its digital transformation, because the integration of digital technologies into products is one of the key aspects of digital transformation [@Hess2016].

To foster the transformation of ideas into new products and services, a dedicated innovation lab was established in 2012. P7S1 generates revenues from its digital products and services both indirectly via advertising and directly via paid content, the sales of virtual goods within online games, or through "freemium" models. Synergies between digital and traditional offerings are actively fostered [@Hess2016].

P7S1's pure digital business unit, called "Digital & Adjacent, is led by a board member and is supported strongly by the CEO. The company has also launched a dedicated incubator ("ProSiebenSat.1 Accelerator") [@Hess2016].

The newspaper publisher MittelBayerische has taken a pragmatic approach to digital technologies. It does not have a department focused on innovation; instead, it introduces established technologies that complement its existing product portfolio. Mittelbayerische believes that the competencies needed for digital transformation should come from within the company and has established a thorough personal development program that helps foster the necessary digital mindset and skill set among existing staff [@Hess2016].

Ravensburger Interactive was launched in the 1990s, but was shut down later: activities in this area were too early and were unsuccessful. Ravensburger has entered the e-book and online gaming markets and has begun to develop complementary digital products that enrich its existing analog products. Although IT remains a support function for its core business activities, IT is regarded as a main driver of innovation within the company's digital business unit. Ravensburger has largely refrained from deploying digital technologies on non-content-related business segments and instead has focused on enriching analog products with digital content. Approximately 20% of Ravensburger's digital revenues are generated by these products. New digital products and services that are less closely related to the core business are organized in a dedicated subsidiary called "Ravensburger Digital", deliberately separated from the core business and physically separated from the headquarters to make it more appealing to applicants with different skill sets and to foster innovation [@Hess2016].

Use of Technologies Dimension:

- Question 1: How Significant is Your Firm's IT to Achieving Strategic Goals?
  Some firms regard IT as an enabler of new business opportunities. Others, however, use IT to support and fulfill defined business requirements and improvements. Companies with an enabling perspective of IT must carefully monitor digital technologies
- Question 2: How Ambitious is Your Firm's Approach to New Digital Technologies?
  Conservative firms may adopt established and widely used technology solutions, while others may deploy new technology solutions at the early stages of their development. A more aggressive approach is to act as an innovator and create and introduce new technology solutions into markets. Firms should consider their existing technological competence, the extent of their technology spending and their size. However, not all media companies have the technological competencies required to become leaders,they should carefully assess their technological ambitions [@Hess2016].

Changes in Value Creation Dimension: Changes in value creation relate mainly to the degree to which a company has already diversified its business into the digital world, how it plans to generate revenues from digital technologies and to its main business focus after a digital transformation [@Hess2016].

- Question 3: How "Digital" is Your Interface to the Customer?
  Many firms want or need to exploit the possibilities of digital technologies and enter new business areas. This means considering how far away it should operate from its traditional core business. The optimal level of diversification is determined by a company's financial background and size [@Hess2016].
- Question 4: How Will You Create Revenue from Future Business Operations?
  Finding new sources of revenue is an indispensable element of a digital transformation strategy. Some companies have tried to overcome constraints by extending their value-chain activities [@Hess2016].
- Question 5: What Will Your Future Business Scope Be?
  Digital technologies may require media companies to rethink the scope of their businesses. Media companies generally maintain their focus on content creation and aggregation, whereas major assets of social media platforms derive from establishing connections between users and profiting from users' content to keep the platforms interesting. In contrast, there are media companies that deliberately shift their product and service portfolios to business areas that are less fundamentally affected by ongoing digital transformation [@Hess2016].
- Question 6: Who is in Charge of the Digital Transformation Endeavor?
  The execution of such a strategy is often delegated to a senior manager. The CIO may also manage the transformation, which is typically the case if the focus is on business processes [@Hess2016].
- Question 7: Do You Plan to Integrate New Operations into Existing Structures or Create Separate Entities?
  Decide whether to integrate new operations into their current operations or to organize them as distinct, separate units (perhaps as a newly formed subsidiary). Integration requires less extensive restructuring efforts, but it is important to examine whether synergies can be exploited. Organizing new digital activities in separate structures makes it easier to explicitly separate (physically and ideologically) old and new operations. Appropriate structures for new operations are more innovative and provide an increased level of flexibility. The greater the distance between digital transformation efforts and a firm's current core activities, the stronger the boundary between new and old operations should be. Digital transformation initiatives often involve significant innovation and change efforts, as well as a willingness to take risks, all of which may be difficult to accommodate within existing organizational structures [@Hess2016].
- Question 8: What Types of Operational Changes Do You Expect?
  New technologies can significantly change the current products and services delivered to customers. Digital technologies can enable changes to business processes. Business processes can be classified as operational, support and management, but the typical focus of digital transformation initiatives is on operational processes. A company must define their processes and assess which of them will be affected by digital transformation [@Hess2016].
- Question 9: Do You Need to Acquire New Competencies? If so, How Do You Plan to Acquire Them?
  Managers must carefully assess the firm's existing technology capabilities and identify the new competencies that will be needed. First option is to build on their current capabilities and acquire the required competencies. This approach typically takes time. Another option is to partner with other companies. This approach reduces the risk of failure. If the technological processes required for digital transformation are well structured and not overly complex, outsourcing these processes is another option. But, in the end, retaining the processes and knowledge required for digital transformation in-house means a company can be better positioned to gain a competitive advantage from future digital transformation initiatives [@Hess2016].

Financial Aspects Dimension: Increasing financial pressure on the current core business might be the trigger that convinces management of the need for action [@Hess2016].

- Question 10: How Strong is the Financial Pressure on Your Current Core Business?
  The willingness of top management to undertake the necessary efforts for, and accept the ensuing risks of, digital transformation endeavors often depends on the competitiveness of the current core business. Managers may not see the urgency for embarking on digital transformation. However, markets can change quickly and acting too late can be fatal [@Hess2016].
- Question 11. How Will You Finance the Digital Transformation Endeavor?
  If a company is already financially struggling, its options for financing digital transformations will be severely limited [@Hess2016].

For example, the automotive industry has introduced digitally enriched products (such as the "connected car") and new business models (such as free-floating car sharing) and an ongoing automation of product development and production processes [@Hess2016].

The most important thing for managers charged with formulating their firms' digital transformation strategies is to know the right questions to ask [@Hess2016].

#### Revamping Your Business Through Digital Transformation. [@WESTERMAN2015]

##### Dimensions

Start by rethinking four traditional assumptions that affect:

- how you relate to your customers
  ASSUMPTION 1: Our customers really value the human touch.
- how you run your operations
  ASSUMPTION 2: We've reached the limit of how far we can automate our operational processes.
- how you organize
  ASSUMPTION 3: Working as an integrated company will slow us down and stifle innovation.
- how you think about your business model.
  ASSUMPTION 4: The strategic assets that brought us success in the physical world will also be valuable in the digital environment.

Technologies:

- Smart mobile devices
- Collaboration platforms
- Big data analytics
- Robotics
- 3-D printing
- Augmented reality
- Internet of Things

##### Quotes

For larger companies in more traditional industries, it's easy to think that digital transformation can wait. However, a follower strategy is wrong [@WESTERMAN2015].

"Digital masters" differ not only in their capability but also in the clarity of their vision. Rather than incrementally adjusting current practices, they search for ways to use today's fast-moving technologies to transform the way they do business [@WESTERMAN2015].

Start by rethinking four traditional assumptions that affect how you relate to your customers, how you run your operations, how you organize and even how you think about your business model [@WESTERMAN2015].

ASSUMPTION 1: Our customers really value the human touch. Not all interactions with humans are actually valuable to customers. Digital innovation can combine no-touch (or limited-touch) service with high customer satisfaction. Some customers today favor self-service over personal interaction. For many young adults in their 20s and early 30s, interacting with a human service representative represents an inconvenience or an extra cost. However, transitioning to a direct-to-consumer model can be difficult: agents or dealers can rebel against what they perceive as a threat to their commissions. But, digital self-service environments can enhance the customer experience and also gather a rich stream of behavioral data that can help boost customer satisfaction and revenues [@WESTERMAN2015].

ASSUMPTION 2: We've reached the limit of how far we can automate our operational processes. In the past, automation worked best for standardized repetitive tasks. It also allows you to radically redesign the way your company operates. Beyond just replacing workers, new technologies can augment their activities or free them to do more fulfilling work [@WESTERMAN2015].

ASSUMPTION 3: Working as an integrated company will slow us down and stifle innovation. Pre-digital wisdom held that centralized companies, while slower to innovate, can be more efficient [and] argued that decentralized companies can be more responsive to local markets. This kind of mind-set forced managers to choose between two suboptimal structures. One of the paradoxes of digital technology is that standardization can actually lead to increased agility. Smart mobile devices, collaboration platforms and big data analytics wire organizations differently. Decentralized companies can have integration where it counts. Integrated systems and centralized processes offer benefits that go beyond efficiency and quality improvement and can also be useful platforms for innovation [@WESTERMAN2015].

Ongoing streams of performance data open up the possibility of conducting controlled experiments on new ideas. Digital leaders have pursued this kind of A/B testing for years on-line and other companies are experimenting in physical settings. Sellers can adjust product bundling and pricing depending on circumstances. Technology are also changing the economics of manufacturing and making custom manufacturing more efficient [@WESTERMAN2015].

ASSUMPTION 4: The strategic assets that brought us success in the physical world will also be valuable in the digital environment. Look for ways to leverage assets that you have and that fast-moving digital startups do not. Use these to establish and grow your digital advantage [@WESTERMAN2015].

PagesJaunes, the French Yellow Pages company, saw that the assets related to printing and delivering books would have little use in the new model, but the company's knowledge of local businesses and the relationships its salespeople had with business owners were potentially critical assets going forward. By leveraging existing data and retraining the sales force, the company is attempting to reinvent itself in partnership with former competitor Google Inc. PagesJaunes began ramping up digital revenues in France faster than physical revenues were declining [@WESTERMAN2015].

Data should be considered an asset class in its own right [and] analytics are useful for more than just optimizing business processes. Equally important is the role of assets in your business model. Traditional companies are taking a fresh look at how they can use the assets they own in new ways to participate in today's "sharing economy" [@WESTERMAN2015].

As digital technology reaches into every corner of the business world, it is creating a new playing field with new rules. digital has reshaped the expectations of customers, the way that employees collaborate and the business models that are possible [@WESTERMAN2015].

Large traditional companies can out-compete fast-moving digital startups if they embrace the digital environment and find ways to make it theirs. Using pre-digital assumptions will not bring success in the digital world. When it comes to digital innovation, "you ainâ€™t seen nothinâ€™ yet" [@WESTERMAN2015].

#### The Business Models Investors Prefer [@PeterWeill2011]

##### Dimensions

Business model defined by: Asset type & Asset right.

The four asset types are:

- Financial assets
- Physical assets
- Intangible assets
- Human assets

The four asset rights are:

- Creators
- Distributors
- Landlords
- Brokers

##### Quotes

we found that in recent years, investors have favored business models focusing on licensing intellectual property.
Surprisingly, we found there is no universally accepted definition of the important concept of a business model. Our business model framework is based on defining the types of assets a company sells and the rights it grants customers to use those assets. We define four asset types and four ways companies manage asset rights to generate revenue.

The four asset types are:

- Financial assets, which include cash as well as securities like stocks, bonds and insurance policies
- Physical assets, which include durable items such as computers, as well as nondurable items such as food
- Intangible assets, which include intellectual property such as patents and copyrights, as well as other intangible assets like knowledge, goodwill and brand value
- Human assets, which include people's time and effort. People of course cannot be legally bought and sold, but their time and knowledge can be "rented out" for a fee.

The four rights types sold:

- Creators, which sell ownership of products they have created
- Distributors, which sell ownership of products they bought
- Landlords, which sell only the right to use assets for a specified period of time
- Brokers, which receive a fee for matching buyers and sellers without ever taking ownership or custody of the product

Disney has dramatically shifted its business model over the last 20 years from renting physical assets like theme parks (to licensing intellectual property), with clear investor buy-in for this strategic shift. Disney stock outperformed the S&P 500 stock index over the last five years.

Manufacturers are generally highly valued by investors, with manufacturers who innovate even more highly valued. Financial and physical landlords were the poorest performing of the common business models, while IP landlords were the second-highest performing. Contractors (that primarily "rent out" human assets) had performance in the middle of the pack.

Innovative manufacturers - which we define as those who invest more than their industry average in research and development - are the top performers in the market. Apple is an example of an innovative manufacturer.

#### The Digital Universe in 2020: Big Data, Bigger Digital Shadows, and Biggest Growth in the Far East [@Gantz2012]

The digital universe lives increasingly in a computing cloud, above terra firma of vast hardware datacenters linked to billions of distributed devices, all governed and defined by increasingly intelligent software. Digital universe is continuously expanding and increasingly complex [@Gantz2012].

The investment in spending on IT hardware, software, services, telecommunications and staff that could be considered the "infrastructure" of the digital universe and telecommunications will grow by 40% between 2012 and 2020. As a result, the investment per gigabyte (GB) during that same period will drop from \$2.00 to \$0.20. A majority of the information in the digital universe, 68% in 2012, is created and consumed by consumers - watching digital TV, interacting with social media, sending camera phone images and videos between devices and around the Internet, and so on. Yet enterprises have liability or responsibility for nearly 80% of the information in the digital universe [@Gantz2012].

Only a tiny fraction of the digital universe has been explored for analytic value. By 2020, as much as 33% of the digital universe will contain information that might be valuable if analyzed. By 2020, nearly 40% of the information in the digital universe will be "touched" by cloud computing providers - meaning that a byte will be stored or processed in a cloud
somewhere in its journey. The amount of information individuals create themselves - writing documents, taking pictures, downloading music, etc. - is far less than the amount of information being created about them in the digital universe [@Gantz2012].

First, while the portion of the digital universe holding potential analytic value is growing, only a tiny fraction of territory has been explored. IDC estimates that by 2020, as much as 33% of the digital universe will contain information that might be valuable if analyzed, compared with 25% today. This untapped value could be found in patterns in social media usage, correlations in scientific data from discrete studies, medical information intersected with sociological data, faces in security footage, and so on [@Gantz2012].

The amount of information in the digital universe that is "tagged" accounts for only about 3% of the digital universe in 2012, and that which is analyzed is half a percent of the digital universe [@Gantz2012].

However, the digital universe astronauts among us - the CIOs, data scientists, digital entrepreneurs - already know the value that can be found in this ever- expanding collection of digital bits. Even though China accounts for only 11% of global GDP today, by 2020 it will account for 40% of the PCs, nearly 30% of smartphones, and nearly 30% of Internet users on the planet - not to mention 20% of the world population [@Gantz2012].

In 2012, we believe 23% of the information in the digital universe (or 643 exabytes) would be useful for Big Data if it were tagged and analyzed. However, technology is far from where it needs to be, and in practice, we think only 3% of the potentially useful data is tagged, and even less is analyzed [@Gantz2012].

To this end, the number of servers (virtual and physical) worldwide will grow by a factor of 10 and the amount of information managed directly by enterprise datacenters will grow by a factor of 14. Meanwhile, the number of IT professionals in the world will grow by less than a factor of 1.5 [@Gantz2012].

By 2020, we'll also be storing a smaller and smaller percentage of our expanding digital universe; yet our digital shadows will be larger than life [@Gantz2012].

The network is growing in importance. Latencies must get shorter. Web sites that gather significant data need to find ways to monetize this asset. Data scientists must be absolutely sure that the intersection of disparate data sets yields repeatable results if new businesses are going to emerge and thrive. Further, companies that deliver the most creative and meaningful ways to display the results of Big Data analytics will be coveted and sought after [@Gantz2012].

#### Big Bang Disruption [@Downes2013]
But the strategic model of disruptive innovation assumes that disrupters start
with a lower-priced, inferior alternative that chips away at the least
profitable segments, giving an incumbent business time to start a skunkworks
and develop its own next-generation products.
The disruption here hasn't come from competitors in the same industry or even
from companies with a remotely similar business model. Nor did the new
technology enter at the bottom of a mature market and then follow a carefully
planned march through larger customer segments.
We're accustomed to seeing mature products wiped out by new technologies and to
ever-shorter product life cycles. But now entire product linesâ€” whole
marketsâ€”are being created or destroyed overnight.
We've found that big-bang disruptions are unplanned and unintentional. They do
not follow conventional strategic paths or normal patterns of market adoption.
Besides being cheaper than established oï¬€erings, they're also more inventive and
better integrated with other products and services.
These oï¬€erings' lightning-fast adoption is a function of near-perfect market
information. Wherever customers are, mobile devices let them search a wide
range of specialized data sourcesâ€”  ...... sâ€”to find the best price and quality
and the next new thing.
big-bang innovations come out of left field, combining existing technologies
that don't even seem related to your oï¬€erings to achieve a dramatically better
value proposition. Big-bang disrupters may not even see you as competition.
They don't share your approach to solving customer needs.
big-bang disrupters enter the market thanks to three defining characteristics:
unencumbered development, unconstrained growth, and undisciplined strategy.
Unencumbered development.
The innovators who create products at "hackathons" aren't even trying to disrupt
your business. You're just the collateral damage.
bigbang innovations:  ...... are often born of rapid-fire, low-cost experiments
on fast-maturing, ubiquitous technology platforms.
these innovations are often built out of readily available components that cost
little or are free.  ...... In the future the most successful innovators may be
those who simply happen upon the right combination of other people's
technologies.
these experiments take place directly in the market, using open platforms built
on the internet, cloud computing, and fast-cycling mobile devices  ...... In
the bizarro world of big-bang disrupters, it is perfectly rational to churn out
dozens of new products and see which ones take hold.
Unconstrained growth. Big-bang disruptions collapse the product life cycle we
know: Everett Rogers's classic bell curve of five distinct customer
segmentsâ€”innovators, early adopters, early majority, late majority, and
laggards. Now there are only two segments: trial users, who often participate
in product  ...... development, and everyone else.
big-bang disruptions can be marketed to every segment simultaneously, right from
the start.
the innovators collectively get it wrong, wrong, wrongâ€”and then unbelievably
right.  ...... In reality, in today's hyperinformed world, each epic failure
feeds consumer expectations for the potential of something dramatically better.
Seemingly random experiments and crash-and-burn flops may actually be your best
warning of an urgent need for a change in strategy, or "strategic pivot." It's
like a battlefield, where near misses signal not that your enemies are confused
or incapable of hitting you but that they are zeroing in on your
positionâ€”walking their fire onto the target, shell by shellâ€”before unloading a
full barrage on your exact location.
The new product cycle can be simplified into three basic stages: development,
deployment, and replacement.
Undisciplined strategy. Big-bang disrupters contradict everything you know about
competitive strategy. According to Michael Treacy and Fred Wiersema's classic
The Discipline of Market Leaders (1995), businesses should align strategic
goals along oneâ€”and only oneâ€”of three value disciplines: low cost  ......
("operational excellence"), constant innovation ("product leadership"), or
customized oï¬€erings ("customer intimacy"). Failing to choose, said the authors,
meant "ending up in a muddle."
Big-bang disrupters, however, are thoroughly undisciplined. They start life with
better performance at a lower price and greater customization. They compete
with mainstream products on all three value disciplines right from the start.
Consider the three major costs in a product or
service: the parts and manufacturing, the embedded technologies and intellectual
property, and a prorated share of development costs. By continually and
dramatically lowering all three at  ...... once, today's technology makes it
possible to sell new products and services more cheaply than the inferior
alternatives they displace.
Customers are so accustomed to this eï¬€ect that they are coming to expect every
product or service to get cheaper and better with each passing day.
Under these conditions you can't win simply by becoming more disciplined with
your current strategy. P  ...... More rigorous strategic focus just blinds you
to the next wave of disruption coming at you from the side.
Google Maps Navigation competes with stand-alone GPS devices on all three value
disciplines: It is clearly the cost leader. It is constantly being updated and
rereleased, making it the leading  ...... innovator as well. And by oï¬€ering
seamless integration with mobile phone contact lists, the web, e-mail, and apps
such as Yelp, it likewise wins on the dimension of customer intimacy.
Surviving Big-Bang Disruption
Upending the Conventional Wisdom  ...... Strategic Discipline
Conventional Wisdom: Focus on only one strategic "discipline" or "generic
strategy"â€”low cost, product innovation, or customer intimacy.  ...... Big-Bang
Wisdom: Compete on all three disciplines at once.  ...... New-Product Marketing
Conventional Wisdom: First target a small group of early adopters and later
enter the mainstream market. Big-Bang Wisdom: Market to all  ...... segments of
users immediately. Be ready to scale upâ€”and exitâ€”swiftly. Innovation Method
Conventional Wisdom: Seek innovation in lower-cost, feature-poor technologies
that meet the needs of underserved customer segments.  ...... Big-Bang Wisdom:
Seek innovation through rapid-îŽŒre, low-cost experimentation on popular
platforms.
Surviving disruption, his research showed, often required a separate
organization to incubate a competitive response. If you did everything right
and the stars aligned, you could then move the new product into the market
using your company's existing infrastructure and advantages of scale, making up
quickly for lost time.
Today, given the potential for "sudden death" from a big bang, you may have no
time to develop an incubated alternative.
Big-bang disruptions usually feature not a vertically integrated supply chain
but a virtually integrated one: They are manufactured and deployed via the
infrastructure of the cloud.
See it coming.
Filter out the noise generated by unencumbered development by finding internal
or external seers who can predict the future with insight and clarity.
Your truth tellers may be easy to identify, if not to accept. They may be
employees far below the ranks of senior management, working on the front lines
of competition and change. They may not be your employees at all. Longtime
customers, venture capitalists, industry analysts, and science fiction writers
may all be truth tellers.
Truth tellers are often eccentric, and their lucidity can easily be mistaken for
arrogance and stubbornness.
The insights of a truth teller may not come in easily digested forms. You need
to learn not only whom to listen to and when, but also how.
Slow the disruptive innovation long enough to better it.  ...... You can't stop
a big-bang disruption once its unconstrained growth has taken oï¬€, but you can
make it harder for its developers to cash in. Many big-bang disrupters build
market share and network eï¬€ects by oï¬€ering their early products free. You can
delay their profitability by lowering prices, locking in customers with long-
term contracts, or forming strategic alliances with advertisers and other
companies critical to your rivals' plans.
Meanwhile, look for opportunities to leverage your surviving assets elsewhere. W
Get closer to the exits, and be ready for a fast escape.  ...... confront the
reality that even long-successful strategies may be suddenly upended, requiring
a radical recreation of the business.  ...... you have to prepare for immediate
evacuation of current markets and be ready to get rid of once-valuable assets.
Incumbents are often trapped by their balance sheets. Traditional accounting
still has little to say about the value of expertise, brands, patents, and
other intangibles. But in a fight against a big-bang disruption, they are the
most valuable of your existing assetsâ€”
For all other kinds of assets, a big-bang disruption can set oï¬€ a rapid decline
in value, making it important not only to shed those technologies but to do so
before they become worthless.
Once customers shift to the new technology, it's too late for a graceful exitâ€”at
best, it's time for a fire sale.
Make sure future strategies are built on a platform that can easily be extended
and experimented with, and quickly scaled both up and down. The profitable life
of a big-bang disrupter may be short, and you'll need to be ready with the next
one before someone beats you to it.
Your Business Is Already Being Disrupted
Try a new kind of diversiîŽŒcation. Diversification has always been a hedge
against risk in cyclical industries. As industry change becomes less cyclical
