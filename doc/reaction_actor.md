### Better information processing from humans

#### 2-way communication instead of 1-way broadcast: Learn to listen

**Worker enablement:** Once-novel technologies such as mobile e-mail, collaboration tools, and video conferencing have now become the norm. Individual level work has, in essence, been virtualized, separating the work process from the location of the work. A firm redesigned its headquarters so that nobody had an assigned desk, even the CEO. Collaboration and networking tools allow employees to talk with anyone in the company. The tools that virtualize individual work, while implemented for cost reasons, have become powerful enablers for knowledge sharing: employees can identify experts and get questions answered in real time [@Westerman2011].

- **Culture issues:** On another level, previously autonomous country managers require coaching to grow comfortable working in an environment of centralized shared services and standardized processes [@Westerman2011].

#### Learning fast & experimenting as a method.

**Experimentation:** Experimentation as the implementation of the lean Startup methodology of testing assumptions and constantly experimenting with controlled risks. A final and critical pre-requisite for experimentation is a willingness to fail. By integrating experimentation as a core value and adopting approaches like Lean Startup, enterprise failures, while still accepted as an inevitable part of risk, can be quick, relatively painless and insightful. Accepting failure free people, ideas and capital for future learning and breakthroughs [@VanGeest2014].

- **Solution delivery:** Development methods in place are often geared to well-defined requirements and mature technologies but not to emerging digital technologies. Mobile and social media require iterative approaches to learn about what will work in the market. Digital Transformation use technology that is not commonly available in enterprises. Analytics activities often require specific knowledge and temperaments that typical IT developers do not possess [@Westerman2011].

Common language (CL): It can facilitate change and overcome some of the barriers that make responding to innovation difficult. It can create a shared perspective to dramatically change the way organizations think and strengthen their ability to identify and develop new ideas. It can help to hardwire new concepts into the organization by the repeated use of terms such as "JOBS-to-be-done"; "good enough"; "invest a little, learn a lot" [@Karimi2015].

Common language for disruptive innovations are able to avoid some of the mental traps that make enabling response to digital disruption difficult. These traps include pursuing perfection when "good enough" is often sufficient, overestimating knowledge of new markets, and making big bets when it is better to begin with small ones [@Karimi2015].

There is a creation of new occupations : skills and continuous learning matter more than ever [@Manyika2015].

Think differently about your workforce. Investing in learning programs make more sense than perpetually recruiting. Companies have to create growth opportunities and other incentives for valued employees to stay [@Manyika2015].

Individuals will have to keep developing their skills throughout their working lives and adjust to a fast-changing job market [@Manyika2015].

#### Agile Strategy, iteration and real-time evaluation over planning

**Death to the Five-Year Plan:** In an exponential world, the five-year plan is not only unworkable, it is seriously counterproductive. The reality is that the future is changing so quickly that any forward look is likely to produce false scenarios. The only solution is to establish a big vision (i.e., an MTP), set an ExO structure into place, implement a one-year plan (at most) and watch it all scale while course-correcting in real time. ExOs, sees five-year plans being replaced with the following elements [@VanGeest2014]:

- MTPs for overall guidance and emotional enrollment.
- Dashboards to provide real time information on how a business is progressing.
- Leveraging "Moments of Impact" for clean, productive decision-making.
- A one-year (at most) operating plan that is connected to the dashboard.

Emphasize agility and learning over forecasting and planning. Change continues to accelerate, so long-term forecasting exercises are less relevant. Agility is more critical than ever. Companies need a mindset focused on learning, experimenting, and iterating [@Manyika2015].

#### Open minds to make cognitive associations

Values: They are the primary building-blocks for culture, which is the pattern of shared values, norms, and practices that distinguishes one organization from another [@Karimi2015].

Values are defined as standards by which employees make priorisation decisions. Innovation requires firms to build and sustain an innovation-supportive culture. Innovative culture derives from values that reinforces the daily practices [@Karimi2015].

**Beware the "Expert":** The best inventions or solutions rarely come from experts; they almost always come from outsiders: from people who aren't domain experts but who offer a fresh perspective. Experts will be the best people to answer questions and identify key challenges, but will provide outdated solutions to those challenges [@VanGeest2014].

Innovative culture (IC): It defines or constrains what an organization can or cannot do, and as such can be a disability when confronting a new innovation. It can stimulate innovative behavior among members of an organization. It can lead an organization to accept innovation as one of its basic values and can foster commitment to it [@Karimi2015].

Organizations need to find out whether their values give them the priority they need to reconfigure their capabilities. If not, values need to be changed first, since values ultimately determine what processes are in place [@Karimi2015].

Multimedia mindset (MM): It actively expands newspaper companies' foci to include a multi-platform approach to serving consumers. It needs to permeate all aspects of a newspaper company and its overall mission. It must take hold institutionally, across the entire organization, and personally, in those leading the transformation [@Karimi2015].

Include a multi-platform or platform-free mindset by considering all forms of content [@Karimi2015].

Developing a digital-first mindset, making digital strategy everyone's job, cultivating an open culture that embraces digital innovations [@Karimi2015].

Adopt a multimedia mindset and view [your] business as a portfolio of products and services with different business models, pricing, and distribution strategies. A mindset that does not favor the status quo [@Karimi2015].

#### Deploy technologies to improve & accelerate information processing

GE has responded by: [@Iansiti2014]

- adding **digital sensors** to its machines,
- connecting them to a **common, cloud-based software platform**
- investing in **modern software development** capabilities
- building **advanced analytics** capabilities

How four digital technologies (analytics, mobile, social media, and embedded devices) are being used in the enterprise. Analytics, Mobile and Social Media are widespread in large organizations. Customer-experience applications of social media are more common than internal uses, reflecting skepticism about how effective they will be for internal collaboration. Analytics, too, are more common in customer experience applications, reflecting organizations' increasing efforts to target marketing activities and personalize customer experience. Mobile is used widely in both domains. Embedded devices are still an emerging technology [@Westerman2011].

Three levels of usage: [@Westerman2011]
- **Substitution** is replacement for substantially the same function
- **Extension** is significantly improving performance or functionality
- **Breakthrough** is fundamentally redefining a process or function

Each is being used to improve customer experience or internal operations. The most common usage of each technology is in substitution. 30 percent of firms are engaging in extension or transformation with Mobile, Social, or Analytics. Usage of embedded devices lags the other technologies. An interesting trend toward transformative opportunities is combining multiple technologies with new management practices. Remote-control equipment and automated factories include both mobile and analytics technologies to improve production. Mobile phones are becoming embedded devices for customer-facing applications. Another firm integrates its social and web-based marketing approaches with its digital product design capabilities and embedded devices in products to be more responsive to emerging consumer preferences. Concept stores combine multiple technologies to test or deliver a new buying experience. [@Westerman2011]

Stop staring in the mirror: a key to adapting to dramatically-shifting marketplaces is to reevaluate what makes you successful and how you measure success. The metrics used to measure performance in the prior era may no longer be relevant [@Gimpel2012].

#### Autonomy improves Speed of Decision-making

**Trust Beats Control and Open Beats Closed:** Autonomy can be a powerful motivator. The Millennial generation is naturally independent, digitally native and resistant to top-down control and hierarchies. To hang on to top talent, companies must embrace an open environment. A new wave of collaborative tools has emerged to allow an organization to monitor each of its teams with little oversight and maximum autonomy. ExOs are learning to deliver self-management, often with extraordinary outcomes, by tracking data on a real-time basis. In an increasingly volatile world, predictable processes and steady, stable environments are now all but extinct. Anything predictable has been or will be automated by AI or robots, leaving the human worker to handle exceptional situations. As a result, the very nature of work is changing and requires more initiative and creativity from every team member. Open trust frameworks cannot be implemented in isolation or simply by fiat. They are an important consequence of implementing Autonomy, Dashboards and/ or Experimentation [@VanGeest2014].

**Autonomy:** A corporate culture that accepts failure benefits from diminished internal politics thanks to trust, transparency and openness. Autonomy as self-organizing, multi-disciplinary teams, operating with decentralized authority. Autonomy does not imply a lack of accountability. "There are still hierarchies in a network, but the hierarchies tend to be competence-based hierarchies, relying more on peer accountability than on authority-based accountability that is, accountability to someone who knows something, rather than to someone simply because they occupy a position, regardless of competence" [@VanGeest2014].

#### Data-based Decision-making leads to better and quicker decisions

**Performance management:** Performance transparency is a key highlight. Digital transformation is actually changing the process of strategic decision-making. Executives are more informed when making decisions and insights allow decisions to be made on real data and not on assumptions. "We can use data to make better decisions about how we prioritize". For example, some executives used the company's existing collaboration tools to extend strategic planning sessions from 12 people to more than 300 of the firm's top managers. This enabled better input into the process and better uptake of the vision after decisions were made [@Westerman2011].

Speed of Decision Making: technology has allowed firms to speed up decisions that otherwise might be slowed due to information flows up and down the hierarchy through multiple layers of management. Leading companies have invested significantly to provide the capability to access diverse streams of information. Slowness in response could mean customers moving away from companies perceived as being out of tune with the new reality. But there are enormous challenges to access, process, and analyze the massive amounts of data that accumulate as a natural by-product of routine transactions. As companies make investments to process increased amounts of data, we find that few have made corresponding investments in the organizational processes to drive business value from data and information. The value lies not in investing in technology but in how increased access to information drives faster and more effective decisions [@Bharadwaj2013].

**Analytics capabilities:** Information management and analytics were highlighted as major goals by executives across industries. "It's time to harvest the data and turn it into insights." It is seen as a way to gain strategic advantage over competitors, by making more-informed and better decisions and reacting more quickly to changes [@Westerman2011].

**Digital globalization:** Local managers, empowered to make decisions autonomously, also gain a broader view of the business through centralized data, have freedom to tailor business to their local needs, but the responsibility to act in the interests of the larger enterprise.  [@Westerman2011]

**Missing skills:** Analytics-based decision-making does not always come naturally to people accustomed to using "professional judgment" [@Westerman2011].

**Culture issues:** Cultural issues can also become a bottleneck for digital transformation. A major cultural issue is related to changes in jobs due to automation or information empowerment. The firm's information-based benefits are reduced by managers who cannot think differently about how they make decisions [@Westerman2011].

**Culture issues:** There is also a need to change the culture when empowering front-line workers. These workers needed help to adopt the idea of using new information capabilities to make autonomous decisions [@Westerman2011].

#### People share more and feel more engaged with their colleagues

**Engagement:** Engagement creates network effects and positive feedback loops with extraordinary reach. The biggest impact of engagement techniques is on customers and the entire external ecosystem. Key attributes of Engagement include [@VanGeest2014]:
  - Ranking transparency
  - Self-efficacy (sense of control, agency and impact)
  - Peer pressure (social comparison)
  - Eliciting positive rather than negative emotions to drive long-term behavioral change
  - Instant feedback (short feedback cycles)
  - Clear, authentic rules, goals and rewards (only reward outputs, not inputs)
  - Virtual currencies or points

**Social Technologies:** Social Technologies are comprised of seven key elements: Social objects, Activity streams, Task management, File sharing, Telepresence, Virtual worlds and Emotional sensing. These elements create transparency and connectedness and, most importantly, lower an organization's information latency. Employee relationship management is just one type of social object that is being information-enabled. Task management is also becoming increasingly social. In the past, it was mostly used as a to-do list, but it is now shifting towards a more Agile approach. Teams are continuously measuring themselves by pushing codes and closing tickets, living by the metrics that task management software provides. File sharing, has recently enjoyed widespread adoption. Telepresence has been around for many years in the form of videoconferencing. While Telepresence lets people interact in a real environment, virtual reality allows interaction, collaboration, coordination and even prototyping in a virtual world. Emotional sensing makes use of sensors, such as health sensors and neurotechnology, within a team or group to create Quantified Employees and a Quantified Workforce to measure everything about themselves and their work, preventing illness, burnout and irritation, and also improving team flow, collaboration and performance. Organizational intimacy is increased, decision latency is reduced, knowledge improves and is more widely spread, and serendipity increases. In short, social technologies enable the real-time enterprise [@VanGeest2014].


### Leadership: guiding instead of controlling

#### Leadership & Vision

One lever for change is to hire new leaders bringing new skills, also bringing a new vision. Senior executives cite a strong vision and frequent communication as essential for driving culture change. Labor relations issues are a stickier source of culture change issues. Employees, fearing job cuts, are strongly resistant [@Westerman2011].

**Governance challenges:** Benefiting from transformation typically requires changes in processes or decision-making that span traditional organizational or functional structures. Organizational change requires top-down effort to help employees envision a different reality. The largest benefits of digital transformation come from truly transforming activities. This requires a more radical vision: one that offers a view of a different way of working, not just a faster or more efficient one. Unless senior executives establish a transformative vision of the future, managers in the rest of the firm will tend to locally optimize within their own spheres of authority. Whereas an overarching vision can span organizational boundaries. Envisioning a single entity with local offices, rather than a collection of independent units, so that each can rapidly adjust to what is learned in another area. These overarching visions establish a picture of what is legitimate and help to delegitimize local behavior that detracts from a more global approach. More common than a lack of vision is a vision that does not go far enough. Overly limited visions can dramatically affect the value obtained from each digital transformation investment [@Westerman2011].

Successful digital transformation comes not from implementing new technologies but from transforming your organization transformation initiatives are centered on re-envisioning customer experience, operational processes and business models. Digital Transformation does not happen bottom up. It must be driven from the top [@Westerman2011].

Focus on the "how" more than the "what." Successful transformations focus on how to drive change as on the detailed content of the change. A compelling transformative vision will allow people to identify new "whats" to meet or extend the vision [@Westerman2011].

Despite the hype around innovative digital technologies, most companies still have a long way to go in their digital transformation journeys. Leadership is essential. That's a management and people challenge, not just a technology one [@Westerman2011].

- Decision 6: Delegate or own the digital agenda?
Advancing the digital agenda takes lots of senior-management time and attention. An effective digital strategy calls for extensive cross-functional orchestration that may require CEO involvement Faced with the need to sort through functional and regional issues related to digitization, some companies are creating a new role: chief digital officer (or the equivalent), a common way to introduce outside talent with a digital mindset to provide a focus for the digital agenda. Relying on chief digital officers to drive the digital agenda carries some risk of balkanization and they may also sacrifice the big picture for a narrower focus, say, on marketing or social media or lack the influence or authority to get support for execution from the functional units. CEOs can choose to "own" and direct the digital agenda personally, top down [@Hirt2014].

- **Coordination issues:** Many firms fail to transform because of coordination difficulties across business units or processes. Units are able to make progress in their own areas, but are unable to influence practices in other units. A firm is even investing in coordination and created a digital division to ensure that all of its digital efforts are being coordinated. A further concern arises from coordination issues between new and traditional businesses or processes: conflict is real, and can be very painful for managers in traditional units that lose when new businesses gain. It often must be addressed through an overarching vision [@Westerman2011].

Senior management needs to go beyond words, and in addition to leaning back and reviewing improvements in the core products, senior management needs to lean forward and work on growth initiatives for non-core products [@Karimi2015].

Senior management support (SMS): It not only signals the importance of innovation to the organization but also helps innovative project teams clear the inevitable obstacles to success and harness senior management's wisdom to improve ideas. It supports activities for building an effective project coalition, developing and communicating a vision, and providing resources to support initiatives [@Karimi2015].

**Envision the digital future for your firm**: Many digital transformation initiatives fail to capture all of the value available to them because their vision is not transformative [@Westerman2011].

**Lead the change from the top:** Top-level vision rarely translates to local-level action unless reinforced through top-down communication and governance. Consistent engagement, backed with appropriate coordination, KPIs, and incentives, make the difficult process of transformation possible [@Westerman2011].

**Ambition setting:** Once an organization has defined its transformative vision, leaders must translate that vision into a set of ambitions and targets that signal to executives and employees "what good looks like" [@Westerman2011].

The Massive Transformative Purpose, or MTP, is the higher, aspirational purpose of the organization. The MTP is so inspirational that a community forms around the ExO and spontaneously begins operating on its own, ultimately creating its own community, tribe and culture. It moves the focal point of a team from internal politics to external impact. The biggest imperative of a worthy MTP is its Purpose. An MTP serves as a stabilizing force during periods of random growth and enables organizations to scale with less turbulence. The MTP is not only an effective attractor and retainer for customers and employees but also for the company ecosystem at large (developers, startups, hackers, NGOs, governments, suppliers, partners, etc.) [@VanGeest2014].

#### Investment decision

**Invest in digital initiatives and skills:** Transformation does not happen without investment. Business case may not be completely clear. It may be a series of low risk experiments. It often becomes a strategic bet that only senior executives can make. Digital transformation requires understanding the need for investment, managing risk, and making the changes necessary to capitalize on the change [@Westerman2011].

- **Unclear business case:** "We're still looking at value and cost. For some folks, the most cost-effective technology is still the desktop." Some initiatives can be justified in the traditional way, through quantified economic business cases. Other investments are truly bet-your-company, do-or-die propositions. Firms facing a burning platform often make large changes without a strict financial business case. As with many innovations, digital transformation investments often have unclear business cases. Experiments are often funded "below the radar". Other initiatives are funded as strategic foundation investments. These investments rarely go through the rigor of developing a quantified business case, but rather are undertaken as strategic bets. When enabling larger transformations, executives often use a combination of approaches over time. Analytics is an interesting example: analytics either generate a better risk/return profile or they don't. However, firms often require an investment in infrastructure (integrating data, buying tools or hiring expertise) before they can start to conduct more measurable analytics-based experiments. The real value of digital transformation comes not from the initial investment, but from continuously re-envisioning how capabilities can be extended with digital technology to increase revenue, cut costs or gain other benefits [@Westerman2011].

- **Lack of impetus:** Impetus often starts at the very top of the firm. Skepticism can result in bureaucratic investment processes that prevent the firm from engaging in useful digitally enabled experiments and business changes. "We've always been fairly slow in adopting technology because we more or less have the ambition of not being first, but we have become even slower at the same time that technology development has been speeding up." If the company is not experiencing pain, the perceived risk of change may outweigh the potential benefits in the minds of many executives [@Westerman2011].

Processes that govern investment decisions are the most crucial processes in which many organizations' most serious disabilities reside when attempting to respond to disruptive innovations [@Karimi2015].

#### Let structure emerge from value

Executives are beginning to envision possibilities that cross organizational and technological silos: letting the possibilities drive technology and organization rather than the reverse. [@Westerman2011]

Value creation is the new structure: Structures often become rigid, causing firms to define themselves by what they do, not how they add value. The structures imprudently shift the focus to creating profits for the firm instead of creating value for customers. A focus on value rather than structure frees enterprises to shake off the mentality of "that's not how we do business.". Companies can build a strong competitive offering around core and essential core support functions, while virtualizing other part of the business through outsourcing, partnerships, and strategic alliances [@Gimpel2012].

If it's not VRIN, it's out: Technological innovations can reshape value chains, causing once-strategic resources to lose their value, identify and build upon strategic resources that will remain valuable after the transition. It must be VRIN: valuable, rare, inimitable, and non-substitutable [@Gimpel2012].

Change the mindset of the marketing by switching: [@Iansiti2014]

_"We are trying to sell them something they don't know they need and they can't see when it works."_
- from the "box seller" mentality: "**features list** with pricing and discount caps"
- to a solution-based sales focused on pain points how to enhance **customer's operating performance**
