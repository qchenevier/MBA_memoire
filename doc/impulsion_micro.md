## Micro-economic scale

### Machines

#### Digital technology

Digital technology has **3 fundamental properties**: [@Iansiti2014]

- digital signals can be transmitted perfectly without error: **no depreciation with time/usage**
- digital signals can be replicated indefinitely: **no production cost**
- digital signals can be communicated to the incremental consumer at zero marginal cost: **no transport cost**

#### Computing & Connectivity everywhere

Each technological revolution has its key factor :

- Railways & the steam engine: cheap coal
- Electricity, heavy chemistry and heavy civil engineering: cheap steel
- Asphalt roads and automobiles: cheap petroleum
- Information & telecommunications: cheap electronic chips.

In each case, the "key factor" steers engineering and investment decisions towards its intensive use. New technology systems are built accordingly, based on: microelectronics, software & telecommunications [@Perez2004]. Today the focus is on connectivity, platforms, data, and software. These spread faster than classic computing hardware due to their network effects and the marginal cost economics associated with it [@Manyika2015]. The post-dotcom decade has seen firms, both established and startups, taking advantage of lower price/performance levels of computing (hardware and software) as well as global connectivity through standard protocols (e.g., Internet and mobile web) [@Bharadwaj2013]. Information goods, powerful computing devices, and inexpensive digital communication is changing business and society [@Gimpel2012].

#### The rise of "Big data"

In the past we have operated under conditions of data (information) scarcity with decisions made with incomplete and often poor quality (even time-lapsed) data, big data create conditions of data (information) abundance due to the massive amount of detailed (and often ready to analyze) data made available [@Bharadwaj2013].

#### Physical capabilities of Digital technologies: automation / robotics / 3D printing / Additive manufacturing

New technologies such as robotics, 3-D printing, augmented reality and the "Internet of Things" will soon lead to major business changes [@WESTERMAN2015].

Digitization has contributed to increasingly jobless recoveries from recessions. The postwar US economy took roughly six months to recover lost jobs after every recession. But it took 15 months to restore lost jobs after the 1991 recession, 39 months after 2001, and 43 months after 2008 [@Manyika2015].

Digitization has contributed to hollowing out the middle-skill portion of the US workforce. Since 2000, the US has created 8 million jobs : only low-skill interactive jobs or high-skill interactive jobs. Whereas, 2.5 million production and transaction jobs have been destroyed [@Manyika2015].

In terms of wages, digitization has accelerated a divergence between the majority of workers and a smaller group at the top. And, since 1980, labor productivity has grown 2.5 times faster than wages, breaking historical patterns [@Manyika2015].

#### Cognitive capabilities of Digital technologies: analytics / AI / deep learning

The Idea that technological advances favor more skilled workers is a twentieth century phenomenon [@Acemoglu2002]. It's long been known that AI and automation/robotics will change markets and workforces. We all need to develop new skills in order to diﬀerentiate ourselves [@Beck2017].

The booming growth of machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI), like most transformational technologies, is both exciting and scary, considering the social and personal implications - and particularly the implications for our careers [@Beck2017].

As AI improves, which is happening quickly, a much broader set of "thinking" rather than "doing" jobs will be aﬀected. Jobs, that, until the last few years, we couldn't imagine being done without the participation of an actual, trained human being [@Beck2017].

It’s easy to see the role of automated systems in data gathering and analysis. We’ve accepted that machines can do these types of tasks efficiently. However, their potential goes much further [@Beck2017].

Many skilled jobs (like Doctors, Financial advisers, Business consultants) follow the same general workflow: [@Beck2017]
1. Gather data
2. Analyze the data
3. Interpret the results
4. Determine a recommended course of action
5. Implement the course of action

Highly skilled workers can command high rates because of three capabilities. Their abilities to go through the early rote tasks quickly and accurately; their experiences and judgment in determining a course of action; and their savviness for helping clients navigate that course. AI and machine
learning will quickly surpass our abilities on the first two capabilities [@Beck2017].

Some people may say that we will never trust machines with important decisions such as the management of our health and money, but this is twentieth century thinking. A new generation is engaging with smart machines that they trust, and often prefer [@Beck2017].

This is the opportunity of improving management decisions as algorithms crunch big data from social technologies or the Internet of Things. Better decision making helps improve performance providing for finer marketing allocations or mitigating operational risks [@Hirt2014].

Software replaces labor in digital businesses. Computers increasingly are performing complex tasks. Even knowledge-intensive areas, such as oncology diagnostics, are susceptible to challenge by machines. Digitization will encroach on a growing number of knowledge roles within companies as they automate many front-line and middle-management jobs based upon synthesizing information for C-level executives [@Hirt2014].

Successful start-ups known for digital expertise and engineer-friendly cultures become magnets for the best digital talent [@Hirt2014]

Those that want to stay relevant in their professions will need to focus on skills and capabilities that artificial intelligence has trouble replicating - understanding, motivating, and interacting with human beings. These human capabilities that will become more and more prized over the next decade. Skills like persuasion, social understanding, and empathy are going to become diﬀerentiators as artificial intelligence and machine learning take over our other tasks. Unfortunately, these human-oriented skills have generally been viewed as second priority in terms of training and education [@Beck2017].

Low probability of automation: Non-routine work examples: legal writing, truck driving, medical diagnoses, persuading [@Frey2017].

3 Tasks categories which won't be automated: [@Frey2017]

- **Perception & Manipulation** tasks: in unstructured work environment (personal house vs airport or train station), irregular objects.
- **Creative Intelligence** tasks: it's making unfamiliar combinations for familiar ideas and find which ones make sense. E.g: jokes. Value is creativity is inherently subjective, so evaluation of a robot on creative Intelligence tasks is not possible.
- **Social intelligence** tasks: involving negotiation, persuasion and care.

Beware: activity that can be off-shored are different than activity that can be automated. E.g.: cashier not off-shorable but replaced by self-service technology [@Frey2017].

Taxonomy of jobs: [@Frey2017]

- High probability of digitization:
  - Routine intensive occupations = well-defined procedures
- Low probability of digitization:
  - Services: because of higher degree of flexibility and physical adaptability
  - Cognitive jobs

### Humans

#### Competition for attention: People want simpler interactions

Innovations create indirect substitutes for consumer time, attention, and money [@Gimpel2012].

Digital technologies create near-perfect transparency: consumers can switch among digital retailers. This dynamic can commoditize products and services as consumers demand comparable features and simple interactions [@Hirt2014].

the degree of consumer attention focused on a relatively small number of brands are redrawing battle lines [@Hirt2014]

Customers, too, are becoming more demanding. There is an "ever-rising tide of customer expectations" for service and convenience. They want to be more in charge. They expect that we know them more [@Westerman2011].

#### Consumer-producer

Since digital news and information content can now be produced by amateurs in addition to professionals: Internet and digitization are competence-destroying and disruptive for the newspaper industry [@Karimi2015].

Millennialization of consumers has turned consumers into producers, empowered individuals to share their voices and influence others [@Gimpel2012].

#### More information means empowerment of consumers and employees

Digital technologies also enable different forms of dynamic capabilities suitable for turbulent environments and transform the structure of social relationships in both the consumer and the enterprise space [@Bharadwaj2013].

Employees are asking why they cannot collaborate with coworkers the way they can with friends. Some younger employees have been heard saying "the company's more than 100 years old, but our IT capabilities don't have to match the age of the company." [@Westerman2011]

Enhancing interactions among customers, suppliers, stakeholders, and employees. Consumers and businesses increasingly prefer digital channels. These channels lower the cost of transactions [@Hirt2014].

Digital technologies know no borders, and the customer's demand for a unified experience is raising pressure on global companies to standardize offerings. They have come to expect payment systems that work across borders, global distribution, and a uniform customer experience [@Hirt2014].

This is because digital resources are “more than just bits and bytes, the digital infrastructure consists of institutions, practices, and protocols that together organize and deliver the increasing power of digital technology to business and society” (Deloitte 2009, p. 2) [@Bharadwaj2013].
