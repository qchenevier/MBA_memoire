## Organizations' action

<!-- What are your assets in this environment? -->
<!-- Why some assets have less value than before? What assets are devaluating quickly? -->
<!-- How are you organized? -->

To understand what are the macro-economic impact as an organization:

- What type of organisation you are analyzing ?
- Depending on the type of organisation, what are the influencing factors impacting the efficiency of the organization ?
- For each influencing factor, what are the current digitalization trends and phenomena modifying these influencing factor ?

Basically, this mental path is following those 3 questions: Who are you ? What are your weak points ? What could hit those weak points ?

Regarding the type of organization, we suggest to segment the organizations using the 3 value disciplines introduced by @Treacy1993. Those 3 value disciplines are not mutually exclusive and should be viewed more as "flavors" than "separate groups". Depending on the size of the organization, it could be focusing on more than one value discipline.

Regarding the influencing factors, we introduce a mapping of the 5 forces introduced by @Porter1979 on each type (of "flavor") of organization. Those forces are seen as being more probably the weak points of a certain type of organization, but they are also greatly depending on the industry context in which the organization is evolving. Like for the value disciplines, the purpose is to guide the focus of the analyst on areas which could be more relevant. But the proposed mapping is flexible and ultimately all the influencing factors should be considered.

### Product Leadership organizations

#### Focus on Speed & Innovation

Product Leadership is striving to produce a continuous stream of state-of-the-art products and services. Products leaders must be creative, which means recognizing and embracing ideas that usually originate outside the company. Innovative companies must commercialize their ideas quickly. All their business and management processes have to be engineered for speed. Product leaders must relentlessly pursue new solutions to the problems that their own latest product or service has just solved. If anyone is going to render their technology obsolete, they prefer to do it themselves [@Treacy1993].

They enjoy the benefits of decentralization (among them, autonomous management, speed, and flexibility). Product leaders work hard at developing an open-mindedness to new ideas. Product leaders create and maintain an environment that encourages employees to bring ideas into the company and, just as important, they listen to and consider these ideas. "Not invented here" is not a part of their vocabularies. Product leaders avoid bureaucracy at all costs because it slows commercialization of their ideas. They "decide today, then implement tomorrow" to shorten their cycle times. They do not plan for events that may never happen, nor do they spend much time on detailed analysis. Their strength lies in reacting to situations as they occur. Fast reaction times are an advantage when dealing with the unknown [@Treacy1993].

Product leaders are their own fiercest competitors. Product leaders also possess the infrastructure and management systems needed to manage risk well [@Treacy1993].

To the third category of customers, new, different, and unusual products count most. These are customers who, are primarily interested in fashion and trends. For a company to succeed in serving these customers, it has to focus on Product Leadership [@Treacy1993].

#### Foresee Substitutes and Threat of Entry

Companies focusing on a Product Leadership value discipline, seem to be primarily impacted by 2 Porter's forces:

- Threat of Entry
- Substitutes

##### Threat of entry

The seriousness of the threat of entry depends on the barriers present and on the reaction from existing competitors that entrants can expect. There are six major sources of barriers to entry:

1. Economies of scale: These economies deter entry by forcing the aspirant either to come in on a large scale or to accept a cost disadvantage [@Porter1979].
1. Product differentiation: Brand identification creates a barrier by forcing entrants to spend heavily to overcome customer loyalty [@Porter1979].
1. Capital requirements: The need to invest large financial resources in order to compete creates a barrier to entry, particularly if the capital is required for unrecoverable expenditures in up-front advertising or R&D [@Porter1979].
1. Cost disadvantages independent of size: Entrenched companies may have cost advantages not available to potential rivals, no matter what their size and attainable economies of scale. Such as learning curve (and of its first cousin, the experience curve), proprietary technology, access to the best raw materials sources, assets purchased at pre-inflation prices, government subsidies, or favorable locations [@Porter1979].
1. Access to distribution channels: The newcomer on the block must, of course, secure distribution of its product or service. Sometimes this barrier is so high that, to surmount it, a new contestant must create its own distribution channels [@Porter1979].
1. Government policy: The government can limit or even foreclose entry to industries with such controls as license requirements and limits on access to raw materials. There are also indirect entry barriers through controls such as air and water pollution standards and safety regulations [@Porter1979].

The company is likely to have second thoughts if incumbents have previously lashed out at new entrants or if:

- The incumbents possess substantial resources to fight back
- The incumbents seem likely to cut prices
- Industry growth is slow, affecting its ability to absorb the new arrival

##### Substitutes

By placing a ceiling on prices it can charge, substitute products or services limit the potential of an industry, unless it can upgrade the quality of the product or differentiate it. Manifestly, the more attractive the price-performance trade-off offered by substitute products, the firmer the lid placed on the industry's profit potential. Substitutes not only limit profits in normal times; they also reduce the bonanza an industry can reap in boom times [@Porter1979].

Substitutes that deserve the most attention strategically are those that [@Porter1979]:

- are subject to trends improving their price-performance trade-off with the industry's product
- are produced by industries earning high profits.

#### Technology lowers barriers to entry

Prosumerization has lowered the break-even point for producers and given birth to low-overhead startups that can compete directly with capital-intensive incumbents [@Gimpel2012].

Conversely, this is an empowering moment for entrepreneurs; the barriers to entry have never been lower [@Manyika2015].

2. Competitors emerge from unexpected places
Digital dynamics often undermine barriers to entry and long-standing sources of product differentiation. Web-based service providers now tap markets without having to build distribution networks of offices. The expense of building brands on-line and the degree of consumer attention focused on a relatively small number of brands are redrawing battle lines in many markets. New competitors can often be smaller companies that will never reach scale but still do a lot of damage to incumbents [@Hirt2014].

Once digital players have established themselves as leaders in one market, they have a striking ability to move into new areas. Amazon went from selling books to selling every retail and a self-publishing platform and a cloud-based business service. Google went from internet search to longevity and biotech research, smart home products, venture capital investing and high-speed internet fiber services [@Manyika2015].

Prepare for tougher, 360-degree competition: coming from thousands of small players in the largest marketplaces and ecosystems, such as small Chinese manufacturers on Alibaba. These small enterprises have the advantage of being "born digital."

Innovation presents great challenges to executives in the communications, information, media, and entertainment (CIME) industries [@Gimpel2012].

#### Increasing pace of innovation

The digital frontier is uncharted territory and the biggest risk of all is being disrupted while sitting on the sidelines [@Manyika2015].

Nearly every executive cited competitive pressures to change. This relates closely to increases in the pace of business. Several executives indicated this was "the new normal" for their industries. None of the executives felt their innovation culture was as strong as it should be [@Westerman2011].

Keeping up with the relentless pace of digital innovation is both a sprint and a marathon [@Manyika2015].

A technology is considered disruptive when its use generates services or physical products with different performance attributes that may not be valued by a company's current customer base. Disruption, however, is not an event or immediate phenomenon but a process that may take several years or even decades [@Karimi2015].

New market entrants often scale up rapidly at lower cost than legacy players can. Digital capabilities increasingly will determine which companies create or lose value [@Hirt2014].

New trends emerge and disruptive entrants appear, their products and services embraced by early adopters. Advanced incumbents then begin to adjust to these changes, accelerating the rate of customer adoption until the industry's level of digitization, among companies but, perhaps more critically, among consumers as well, reaches a tipping point. Eventually, what was once radical is normal [@Hirt2014].

Kurzweil identified a hugely important and fundamental property of technology: when you shift to an information-based environment, the pace of development jumps onto an exponential growth path and price/performance doubles every year or two. Whereas the experts in many fields will project linearly in times of exponential change [@VanGeest2014].

The pace of change isn't going to slow down anytime soon. In fact, Moore's Law all but guarantees that it will continue to speed up -and speed up exponentially- for at least several decades. And given the cross impact into other technologies, if the last fifteen years has seen enormous disruption in the business world, the next fifteen will make that disruption seem tame by comparison  [@VanGeest2014].

**Information Accelerates Everything:** The new information paradigm is accelerating the metabolism of products, companies and industries. In industry after industry, the development cycle for products and services grows ever shorter. Nowhere is this staggering pace of change more apparent than with the consumer Internet. Many products are now launched early, unfinished and in perpetual beta, for the sole purpose of gathering data from users as early as possible to determine how to "finish" the product [@VanGeest2014].

**Disruption is the New Norm:** Every industry is becoming information-based, either by being digitized or by using information to identify under-utilized assets. Collaborative Consumption leverages the internet and social networks to create a more efficient utilization of physical assets, the outsider has all the advantages. With no legacy systems to worry about, as well as the ability to enjoy low overhead and take advantage of the democratization of information and, more important, technology, the newcomer can move quickly and with a minimum of expense. The rate of change is so high everywhere these days that you now must assume that someone will disrupt you, and often from a direction you least expect. The authors see a consistent set of steps around disruptive innovation comprising the following [@VanGeest2014]:

- Domain (or technology) becomes information-enabled
- Costs drop exponentially and access is democratized
- Hobbyists come together to form an open source community
- New combinations of technologies and convergences are introduced
- New products and services appear that are orders of magnitude better and cheaper
- The status quo is disrupted (and the domain gets information-enabled)

#### Network effects & self-reinforcing winner-takes-all dynamics

Digital businesses reduce transaction and labor costs, increase returns to scale from aggregated data. Scale economies in data and talent often are decisive [@Hirt2014].

Businesses that rely too heavily on a single revenue stream or on playing an intermediary role in a given market are particularly vulnerable. In some markets, there is a winner-take-all effect [@Manyika2015].

Network Effects Within Multisided Platforms Create Rapid Scale Potential: Network effects happen when the value of a good or a service increases as more consumers use them or as more supply-side partners augment the service. More and more, network effects become the key differentiator and driver of value creation. Firms should consider the role of network effects and multisided business models, which can be instantiated on the supply side with digitally interconnected partner-ships and on the demand side with interconnections among web pages.  [@Bharadwaj2013]

At a broad level, the industries with the fastest profit margin growth tend to be those with the fastest growth in software intensity. And within these sectors, the margin spreads between the top-performing companies and the lowest performers are two to four times those in other sectors. The most digitized industries are developing a winner-take-all dynamic [@Manyika2015].

### Customer Intimacy

#### Focus on Adaptation & Customization

Those pursuing a strategy of Customer Intimacy continually tailor and shape products and services to fit an increasingly fine definition of the customer. Customer-intimate companies are willing to spend now to build customer loyalty for the long term. They typically look at the customer's lifetime value to the company, not the value of any single transaction. Their first priority is to make sure the customer gets the right product. Such companies understand well is the difference between profit or loss on a single transaction and profit over the lifetime of their relationship with a single customer. They know that not all customers require the same level of service or will generate the same revenues. They deploy CRMs that segment its services with great eﬃciency, to direct certain value-added services or products to a specific group of clients [@Treacy1993].

Kraft has the information systems, analytical capability, and educated sales force to allow it to develop as many different so-called micro-merchandising programs for a chain that carries its products as the chain has stores. It had to create the organization, build the information systems, and educate and motivate the people required to pursue a strategy of Customer Intimacy. Kraft decentralized its marketing operation in order to empower the people actually dealing with the customer. It also is giving them the data they need to make intelligent recommendations. Kraft has assembled a centralized information system. Its business processes stress flexibility and responsiveness. Its information systems collect, integrate, and analyze data from many sources. Its organizational structure emphasizes empowerment of people working close to customers, and its hiring and training programs stress the creative decision-making skills required to respond to individual customer needs. Its management systems recognize and utilize such concepts as customer lifetime value [@Treacy1993].

The second set of customers is more concerned with obtaining precisely what they want or need. Customers in this group ascribe value to a product or service according to how closely it appears to be designed just for them. These customers require a company to focus on Customer Intimacy [@Treacy1993].

#### Foresee Powerful suppliers

Customer Intimacy relates primarily to one of Porter's forces: Powerful suppliers.

##### Powerful suppliers

Suppliers can exert bargaining power on participants in an industry by raising prices or reducing the quality of purchased goods and services [@Porter1979].

A supplier group is powerful if [@Porter1979]:

- It is dominated by a few companies and is more concentrated than the industry it sells to.
- Its product is unique or at least differentiated, or if it has built up switching costs.
- It is not obliged to contend with other products for sale to the industry.
- It poses a credible threat of integrating forward into the industry's business.
- The industry is not an important customer of the supplier group.

A company's choice of suppliers to buy from should be viewed as a crucial strategic decision [@Porter1979].

#### Consumer are also Information producers, shifting business models

Enabling new business or operating models, such as peer-to-peer product innovation (crowd-source features rather than investing heavily in R&D) or customer service (crowd-source customer service, so that users support each other to resolve problems), disintermediate existing customer-supplier relations [@Hirt2014].

(CIME) industries face dramatic changes in revenue streams and shifts in industry dynamics. Traditional business models face threats [@Gimpel2012].

#### Customization improved by reduced information asymmetry

Increased Value from Information: the digital business context brings new opportunities to create value from information. Many firms are able to fine-tune their actions and personalize their offerings based on information about customer preferences. Democratization of content as well as the subsequent sharing, remixing, redistribution, and resyndication of content have caused dramatic power shifts in market channels and dis-intermediations that disrupt traditional sources of economic profits while creating fundamentally new sources of value [@Bharadwaj2013].

Digitization allows companies to split jobs into smaller and more specialized tasks. Producers are better able to create specialized offerings for small markets: e.g.: investment advisory business has become disaggregated. Large retail banks similarly face a growing array of small, tech-enabled challengers [@Manyika2015].

### Operational Excellence

#### Focus on Optimization & Price-performance ratio

Operational Excellence describes a specific strategic approach to the production and delivery of products and services. The objective is to lead in price and convenience: to minimize overhead costs, to eliminate intermediate production steps, to reduce transaction and other "friction" costs, and to optimize business processes. They focus on delivering their products or services to customers at competitive prices and with minimal inconvenience [@Treacy1993].

Dell outperformed by cutting dealers out of the distribution process, building to order rather than to inventory, fostering a disciplined, extremely low-cost culture [@Treacy1993].

General Electric reinvented its operating model-the way it made, sold, and distributed appliances. GE introduced the "virtual inventory," a computer-based logistics system that allows stores to operate as though they had hundreds of ranges and refrigerators in the back room when in fact they have none at all. They have instantaneous access to GE's on-line order-processing to place orders for next-day delivery. Dealers have had to give up some independence from the supplier. Virtual inventory works better than real inventory for both dealers and customers and saves about 12% of distribution and marketing costs to GE. With Direct Connect, GE knows that vendors' orders are, in fact, actual sales to customers. GE links its order-processing system to other systems involved in forecasting demand and planning production and distribution. The company now, in effect, manufactures in response to customer demand instead of to inventory. It implemented automated inventory replenishment and invoice-less payments and integrated disparate logistics systems [@Treacy1993].

Companies that have adopted a strategy of Operational Excellence also have built their operations around information systems that emphasize integration and low-cost transaction processing [@Treacy1993].

One set of potential customers denes value within a matrix of price, convenience, and quality, with price the dominant factor. These customers are less particular about what they buy than they are about getting it at the lowest possible price and with the least possible hassle. The business that succeeds by serving these customers focuses on Operational Excellence [@Treacy1993].

#### Foresee Rivals jockeying for position and Powerful buyers

Related primarily to 2 Porter's forces:

- Rivals jockeying for position
- Powerful buyers

##### Rivals jockeying for position

Rivalry among existing competitors takes the familiar form of jockeying for position-using tactics like price competition, product introduction, and advertising slugfests. Intense rivalry is related to the presence of a number of factors [@Porter1979]:

- Competitors are numerous or are roughly equal in size and power.
- Industry growth is slow.
- The product or service lacks differentiation or switching costs.
- Fixed costs are high or the product is perishable.
- Capacity is normally augmented in large increments.
- Exit barriers are high. Exit barriers, like very specialized assets or management's loyalty to a particular business, keep companies competing even though they may be earning low returns on investment.
- The rivals are diverse in strategies, origins, and "personalities", and continually run head-on into each other.

As an industry matures, its growth rate changes, resulting in declining profits and (often) a shakeout. Technological innovation can boost the level of fixed costs in the production process. While a company must live with many of these factors (because they are built into industry economics) it may have some latitude for improving matters through strategic shifts. For example, it may try to raise buyers' switching costs or increase product differentiation [@Porter1979].

##### Powerful buyers

Customers likewise can force down prices, demand higher quality or more service, and play competitors off against each other, all at the expense of industry profits [@Porter1979].

A buyer group is powerful if [@Porter1979]:

- It is concentrated or purchases in large volumes.
- The products it purchases from the industry are standard or undifferentiated.
- The products it purchases from the industry form a component of its product and represent a significant fraction of its cost. Where the product sold by the industry in question is a small fraction of buyers' costs, buyers are usually much less price sensitive.
- It earns low profits, which create great incentive to lower its purchasing costs. Highly profitable buyers, however, are generally less price sensitive.
- The industry's product is unimportant to the quality of the buyers' products or services.
- The industry's product does not save the buyer money.
- The buyers pose a credible threat of integrating backward to make the industry's product.

A company's choice of buyer groups to sell to should be viewed as a crucial strategic decision [@Porter1979].

Rarely do all the buyer groups a company sells to enjoy equal power. Segments usually exist within that industry that exercise less power (and that are therefore less price sensitive) than others. For example, the replacement market for most products is less price sensitive than the overall market [@Porter1979].

As a rule, a company can sell to Powerful Buyers and still come away with above- average profitability only if it is a low-cost producer in its industry or if its product enjoys some unusual, if not unique, features. If the company lacks a low cost position or a unique product, selling to everyone is self-defeating because the more sales it achieves, the more vulnerable it becomes. The company may have to muster the courage to turn away business and sell only to less potent customers [@Porter1979].

#### Reduced information asymmetry information augments the buyers' power

Consumers have been big winners in the digital economy, although most of this effect does not show up as GDP. Some tech firms are providing free products or services where traditional businesses once charged fees. In these cases, the consumer gains are siphoning value out of industries [@Manyika2015].

Information becomes widely available, disrupting traditional intermediaries: Value is shifting from physical intermediaries and asset holders to digital intermediaries and to consumers [@Manyika2015]. Internet information is now cheap, open standards have also facilitated open distribution platforms which have further resulted in more flexibility for consumers. Aggregative news services are becoming more important intermediaries [@Karimi2015]. Consider the automotive industry, Consumers now save time by comparing vehicles on-line and their on-line activity leaves a data trail that dealers can use [@Manyika2015].

**New pressure on prices and margins** Third parties have jumped into this fray, disintermediating relationships between companies and their customers. The rise of price-comparison sites and these dynamics create downward pressure on returns across consumer-facing industries, and the disruptive currents are now rippling out to B2B businesses [@Hirt2014].

Globalization reshapes the nature of supply and demand. Consumers enjoy a new world of choice [@Gimpel2012].

Power players accustomed to monopoly profits face unprecedented competition [@Gimpel2012].

The nature of productivity growth has changed in the past decade. Economic statistics do not reflect the full benefits of those innovations in the lives of consumers. Statistics are not capturing an important and innovative part of the economy because the productivity advance flows to unmeasured consumer surplus. E.g.: it is difficult for data to capture quality improvements and innovation in digital content and new capabilities in subsequent generations of advanced software [@Manyika2015].

#### Distribution improved by platformization

Communications firms face substitution from over-the-top services [@Gimpel2012].

In B2B markets, corporate purchasers are raising pressure on their suppliers to offer services that are standardized across borders, integrate with other offerings, and can be plugged into the purchasing companies' global business processes easily [@Hirt2014].

Platformization is the emergence of Digital platforms that bring together suppliers, customers, and third parties. They are replacing traditional middlemen and can often serve to level the playing field by granting small players and new entrants access to formerly closed markets [@Gimpel2012]. While physical processes have high marginal costs, low-marginal-cost economics and platform architecture has allowed the most successful high-tech firms to achieve a scale that was once impossible. The power of platform economics is reflected in the gross margins, which can run as high as 80 percent [@Manyika2015].

### Other

Although large traditional firms are truly different from digital entrants, many are starting to transform their businesses successfully through digital technology. Companies face common pressures from customers, employees and competitors [@Westerman2011].

Globalization is a driver for some firms: there is a strategic need to expand globally or pressures to generate information and process synergies [@Westerman2011].
Some firms mentioned M&A as a pressure to transform [@Westerman2011].

#### Technological systems (not technologies) usage is exploding

By using mobile devices, social media, analytics and the cloud, savvy companies are transforming the way they do business [@WESTERMAN2015].

The digital technologies underlying competitive threats may not be new, but they are being used to new effect [@Hirt2014]. The complex patterns of dynamic interdependencies among environmental turbulence, dynamic capabilities, and IT systems have resulted in the phenomenon called "digital ecodynamics" [@ElSawy2010].

The "plug and play" nature of digital assets causes value chains to disaggregate, creating openings for focused, fast-moving competitors [@Hirt2014].

The most explosive growth is now in usage [@Manyika2015].

Usage is exploding as companies build new types of digital assets, putting powerful tools in the hands of employees and devising new ways of working [@Manyika2015].

Today the race is on to capture value from data analytics and the Internet of Things, but there is no finish line : Digitization involves continuously experimenting and adapting [@Manyika2015].

#### Talent acquisition vs asset acquisition

The competition to hire talent is now global, as technologies evolve faster and technology usage is exploding to increase automation.

There are Growing talent mismatches between companies. Companies are struggling to find the right talent in areas that can't be automated. Such areas include digital skills like those of artificial-intelligence programmers or data scientists and of people who lead digital strategies and think creatively about new business designs. One global company, for example, is simultaneously planning to cut more than 10,000 employees (some through digital economies) while adding 3,000 to its digital business [@Hirt2014].

Between 2012 and 2020, the patch of the digital universe that CIOs and their IT staffs need to manage will become not just bigger but also more complex. The skills, experience, and resources to manage all these bits of data will become scarcer and more specialized, requiring a new, flexible, and scalable IT infrastructure that extends beyond the enterprise [@Gantz2012].

Between 2014 and 2020, the amount of data managed per each IT professional will increase 6-fold, from 230 gigabytes in 2014 to 1231 gigabytes in 2020, requiring new abilities to scale up infrastructure and analytics to manage this data [@IDC/EMC2014].

For workers, wage growth has been approximately twice as fast as the national average in the most highly digitized industries and those who lack digital skills face narrowing job prospects [@Manyika2015].
