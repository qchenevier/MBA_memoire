#### Competitive forces to analyze Organizations' environment

To understand what are the macro-economic impacts of digitalization as an organization, we propose to use the 5 competitive forces introduced by @Porter1979. Those forces are greatly depending on the industry context in which the organization is evolving and might also represents specific weak points depending on the characteristics of each organization.

The essence of strategy formulation is coping with competition. Yet it is easy to view competition too narrowly and too pessimistically. While one sometimes hears executives complaining to the contrary, intense competition in an industry is neither coincidence nor bad luck [@Porter1979].

Competition is not manifested only in the other players. Competition in an industry is rooted in its underlying economics, and competitive forces exist that go well beyond the established combatants in a particular industry. Customers, suppliers, potential entrants, and substitute products are all competitors that may be more or less prominent or active depending on the industry. Knowledge of these underlying sources of competitive pressure provides the groundwork for a strategic agenda of action [@Porter1979].

The strongest competitive force or forces determine the profitability of an industry and so are of greatest importance in strategy formulation. Even a company with a strong position in an industry unthreatened by potential entrants will earn low returns if it faces a superior or a lower-cost substitute product. Every industry has an underlying structure, or a set of fundamental economic and technical characteristics, that gives rise to these competitive forces [@Porter1979].

Industry evolution is important strategically because evolution, of course, brings with it changes in the sources of competition. In the familiar product life-cycle pattern, for example, growth rates change, product differentiation is said to decline as the business becomes more mature, and the companies tend to integrate vertically. These trends are not so important in themselves; what is critical is whether they affect the sources of competition [@Porter1979].

We suggest that the competitive forces in each industry are being intensified and taking new forms due to Digitalization and the emergence of all kind of Networks. This part aims at describing those networks and those digital trends and how they might change the various competitive forces in each industry.

### Networks
#### All kinds of networks are growing: Virtual Networks or Platforms

First, focus on the word network. It is enlightening to view information technologies in terms of virtual networks, which share many properties with real networks such as communications and transportation networks. We think of all users of Macintosh users as belonging to the "Mac network." Apple is the sponsor of this network. Building a network involves more than just building a product: finding partners, building strategic alliances, and knowing how to get the bandwagon rolling can be every bit as important as engineering design skills [@Shapiro1999].

Platformization is the emergence of Digital platforms that bring together suppliers, customers, and third parties. They are replacing traditional middlemen and can often serve to level the playing field by granting small players and new entrants access to formerly closed markets [@Gimpel2012]. While physical processes have high marginal costs, low-marginal-cost economics and platform architecture has allowed the most successful high-tech firms to achieve a scale that was once impossible. The power of platform economics is reflected in the gross margins, which can run as high as 80 percent [@Manyika2015]. Communications firms face substitution from over-the-top services [@Gimpel2012].

We are all familiar with physical networks such as telephone networks, railroad networks, and airline networks. Some high-tech networks are much like these "real" networks: networks of compatible fax machines. But many other high-tech products reside in "virtual" networks: the network of Macintosh, the network of Apple iPhone users, the network of Android Users [@Shapiro1999].

Network effects happen when the value of a good or a service increases as more consumers use them or as more supply-side partners augment the service (see next part about [network externalities](#network-externalities)). More and more, network effects become the key differentiator and driver of value creation. Firms should consider the role of network effects and multisided business models, which can be instantiated on the supply side with digitally interconnected partnerships and on the demand side with interconnections among web pages [@Bharadwaj2013].

Overall, as Information is growing and getting more accessible, there is an increase of connections of all kinds between actors and organizations around the world: all kinds of networks are being formed and growing.

#### Network externalities as a positive feedback {#network-externalities}

Large networks are more attractive to users than small ones. The term that economists use to describe this effect, network externalities, usefully highlights two aspects of information systems that are crucial for competitive strategy [@Shapiro1999].

When the value of a product to one user depends on how many other users there are, economists say that this product exhibits network externalities, or network effects. Communications technologies are a prime example: telephones, e-mail, Internet access, fax machines, and modems all exhibit network externalities. Technologies subject to strong network effects tend to exhibit long lead times followed by explosive growth. The pattern results from positive feedback: as the installed base of users grows, more and more users find adoption worthwhile. Eventually, the product achieves critical mass and takes over the market [@Shapiro1999].

Externalities arise when one market participant affects others without compensation being paid. Like feedback, externalities come in two flavors: negative and positive. The classic example of a negative externality is pollution: my sewage ruins your swimming or drinking water. Happily, network externalities are normally positive, not negative: when I join your network, the network is bigger and better, to your benefit. Positive network externalities give rise to positive feedback: when I buy a fax machine, you are more tempted to get one yourself since you can now use it to communicate with me [@Shapiro1999].

In virtual networks, the linkages between the nodes are invisible, but no less critical for market dynamics and competitive strategy. We are in the same computer network if we can use the same software and share the same files. Whether real or virtual, networks have a fundamental economic characteristic: the value of connecting to a network depends on the number of other people already connected to it. This fundamental value proposition goes under many names: network effects, network externalities, and demand-side economies of scale. They all refer to essentially the same point: other things being equal, it's better to be connected to a bigger network than a smaller one [@Shapiro1999].

Network externalities are what lie behind Metcalfes law, named after Bob Metcalfe, the inventor of Ethernet. The square of the Metcalfe's law is more a rule of thumb than a law but it does arise in a relatively natural way. If there are n people in a network, and the value of the network to each of them is proportional to the number of other users, then the total value of the network (to all the users) is proportional to $n * (n - 1)$ which is roughly equal to $n^2$. The value of a network goes up as the square of the number of users [@Shapiro1999].

Positive feedback and network externalities are not a creation of the 1990s. To the contrary, network externalities have long been recognized as critical in the transportation and communications industries, where companies compete by expanding the reach of their networks and where one network can dramatically increase its value by interconnecting with other networks. Anyone trying to navigate the network economy has much to learn from the history of the postal service, railroads, airlines, and telephones [@Shapiro1999].

#### Positive feedback create tippy markets: the winner takes all {#information-dynamics}

Digital businesses reduce transaction and labor costs, increase returns to scale from aggregated data. Scale economies in data and talent often are decisive [@Hirt2014].

There is a central difference between the old and new economies: the old industrial economy was driven by economies of scale; the new information economy is driven by the economics of networks. The key concept is positive feedback [@Shapiro1999].

Businesses that rely too heavily on a single revenue stream or on playing an intermediary role in a given market are particularly vulnerable. In some markets, there is a winner-take-all effect. At a broad level, the industries with the fastest profit margin growth tend to be those with the fastest growth in software intensity. And within these sectors, the margin spreads between the top-performing companies and the lowest performers are two to four times those in other sectors. The most digitized industries are developing a winner-take-all dynamic [@Manyika2015].

Positive feedback makes the strong get stronger and the weak get weaker, leading to extreme outcomes. Positive feedback should not be confused with growth as such. Yes, if a technology is on a roll, as is the Internet today^[In 1999, when it is written, it is mostly true, even if the dotcom bubble hadn't burst yet. It is less striking now.], positive feedback translates into rapid growth: success feeds on itself. This is a virtuous cycle. When two or more firms compete for a market where there is strong positive feedback, only one may emerge as the winner. Economists say that such a market is tippy, meaning that it can tip in favor of one player or another. Examples of tippy markets were the video recorder market in the 1980s (VHS v. Beta) and the personal computer operating systems market of the 1990s (Wintel v. Apple). In its most extreme form, positive feedback can lead to a winner-take-all market in which a single firm or technology vanquishes all others. These dynamics are driven by the strong desire of users to select the technology that ultimately will prevail-that is, to choose the network that has (or will have) the most users [@Shapiro1999].

#### Competition is on avoiding Negative-feedback

**from long-lived oligopolies to temporary monopolies**
The industrial economy was populated with oligopolies: industries in which a few large firms dominated their markets. This was a comfortable world, in which market shares rose and fell only gradually. This stability in the marketplace was mirrored by lifetime employment of managers. In contrast, the information economy is populated by temporary monopolies. Hardware and software firms vie for dominance, knowing that today's leading technology or architecture will, more likely than not, be toppled in short order by an upstart with superior technology [@Shapiro1999].

**negative feedback leads to long-lived oligopolies**
The backward cousin of positive feedback is negative feedback. The industrial oligopolies exhibited negative feedback, at least in their mature phase. Attempts by the industry leader to capture share from smaller players would often trigger vigorous responses as smaller players sought to keep capacity utilization from falling. Furthermore, past a certain size, companies found growth difficult owing to the sheer complexity of managing a large enterprise. Sometimes sales fell below a critical mass, and companies went out of business or were acquired by more efficient rivals. But by and large, dramatic changes in market share were uncommon and oligopoly rather than monopoly was the norm [@Shapiro1999].

**demand-side economies of scale are a sustaining network effect creating a positive feedback**
Positive feedback is not entirely new; virtually every industry goes through a positive feedback phase early in its evolution. General Motors was more efficient than the smaller car companies in large part because of its scale. This efficiency fueled further growth by General Motors. This source of positive feedback is known as economies of scale in production: larger firms tend to have lower unit costs (at least up to a point). From today's perspective, we can refer to these traditional economies of scale as supply-side economies of scale. Despite its supply-side economies of scale, General Motors never grew to take over the entire automobile market. Because traditional economies of scale based on manufacturing have generally been exhausted at scales well below total market dominance. In other words, positive feedback based on supply-side economies of scale ran into natural limits, at which point negative feedback took over. These limits often arose out of the difficulties of managing enormous organizations [@Shapiro1999].


### Value propositions are increasingly network-based

#### Increasing pace of innovation & technological change

Today, a typical automotive design cycle is approximately 24 to 36 months, which is much faster than the 60-month life cycle from five years ago [@McGrath2013].

Nearly every executive cited competitive pressures to change. This relates closely to increases in the pace of business. Several executives indicated this was "the new normal" for their industries. None of the executives felt their innovation culture was as strong as it should be [@Westerman2011].

Keeping up with the relentless pace of digital innovation is both a sprint and a marathon [@Manyika2015].

Kurzweil identified a hugely important and fundamental property of technology: when you shift to an information-based environment, the pace of development jumps onto an exponential growth path and price/performance doubles every year or two. Whereas the experts in many fields will project linearly in times of exponential change [@VanGeest2014].

Information Accelerates Everything: The new information paradigm is accelerating the metabolism of products, companies and industries. In industry after industry, the development cycle for products and services grows ever shorter. Nowhere is this staggering pace of change more apparent than with the consumer Internet. Many products are now launched early, unfinished and in perpetual beta, for the sole purpose of gathering data from users as early as possible to determine how to "finish" the product [@VanGeest2014].

The digital frontier is uncharted territory and the biggest risk of all is being disrupted while sitting on the sidelines [@Manyika2015].

The pace of change isn't going to slow down anytime soon. In fact, Moore's Law all but guarantees that it will continue to speed up -and speed up exponentially- for at least several decades. And given the cross impact into other technologies, if the last fifteen years has seen enormous disruption in the business world, the next fifteen will make that disruption seem tame by comparison  [@VanGeest2014].
k
#### What are Substitutes

By placing a ceiling on prices it can charge, substitute products or services limit the potential of an industry, unless it can upgrade the quality of the product or differentiate it. Manifestly, the more attractive the price-performance trade-off offered by substitute products, the firmer the lid placed on the industry's profit potential. Substitutes not only limit profits in normal times; they also reduce the bonanza an industry can reap in boom times [@Porter1979].

Substitutes that deserve the most attention strategically are those that [@Porter1979]:

- are subject to trends improving their price-performance trade-off with the industry's product
- are produced by industries earning high profits.

#### Increased Sustitutes from Network-based products

As products become more and more information-enabled, their markets are displaying more and more network-based markets characteristics: tippy markets, network effects and positive feedback. A substitute product which may not pose a threat at the beginning might become one, once the network it is based has grown enough.

Consumers have been big winners in the digital economy, although most of this effect does not show up as GDP. Some tech firms are providing free products or services where traditional businesses once charged fees. In these cases, the consumer gains are siphoning value out of industries [@Manyika2015].

An example is given by the industry of GPS tracking devices which has not seen the disruption coming from the introduction of smartphones.  

#### Increasing rate of disruption & market change

Disruption has no consensual definition. However, it seems to be mostly used to depict the fact some innovations can push some incumbents out of market, barely letting them the ability to adapt. It is the fact some customer needs are met by innovations radically different from the previous state-of-the-art. We propose here that _Disruption_ is in fact the same thing as the _Substitution_ depicted by @Porter1979.

A radical innovation is the introduction of a truly new product or process. They can be introduced at any point in time cutting short the life cycle of the products or processes they substitute [@Perez2004].

Disruption, however, is not an event or immediate phenomenon but a process that may take several years or even decades [@Karimi2015]. Every radically new product, when it is first introduced, is relatively primitive. Gradually, it consolidates a position in the market. Then, there is a sort of take-off for a period of successive incremental improvements. At last, the technology reaches maturity [@Perez2004].

Neither age nor size nor reputation nor even current sales guarantee that you will be around tomorrow. The lifespan of a company is going to get even shorter in the years to come as giant corporations aren't just forced to compete with, but are annihilated -seemingly overnight- by a new breed of companies that harnesses the power of exponential technologies [@VanGeest2014].

Those enterprises that don't jump aboard soon will be left on the ash heap of history joining Iridium, Kodak, Polaroid, Philco, Blockbuster, Nokia and a host of other once-great, industry-dominant corporations unable to adapt to rapid technological change [@VanGeest2014].

Both demand-side economies of scale and supply-side economies of scale (see [this part](#information-dynamics) for more information) have been around for a long time. But the combination of the two that has arisen in many information technology industries is new. The result is a "double whammy" in which growth on the demand side both reduces cost on the supply side and makes the product more attractive to other users-accelerating the growth in demand even more. The result is especially strong positive feedback, causing entire industries to be created or destroyed far more rapidly than during the industrial age [@Shapiro1999]. New market entrants often scale up rapidly at lower cost than legacy players can. Digital capabilities increasingly will determine which companies create or lose value [@Hirt2014].

New trends emerge and disruptive entrants appear, their products and services embraced by early adopters. Advanced incumbents then begin to adjust to these changes, accelerating the rate of customer adoption until the industry's level of digitization, among companies but, perhaps more critically, among consumers as well, reaches a tipping point. Eventually, what was once radical is normal [@Hirt2014].

Disruption is the New Norm: Every industry is becoming information-based, either by being digitized or by using information to identify under-utilized assets. Collaborative Consumption leverages the internet and social networks to create a more efficient utilization of physical assets, the outsider has all the advantages. With no legacy systems to worry about, as well as the ability to enjoy low overhead and take advantage of the democratization of information and, more important, technology, the newcomer can move quickly and with a minimum of expense. The rate of change is so high everywhere these days that you now must assume that someone will disrupt you, and often from a direction you least expect. There is a consistent set of steps around disruptive innovation comprising the following [@VanGeest2014]:

- Domain (or technology) becomes information-enabled
- Costs drop exponentially and access is democratized
- Hobbyists come together to form an open source community
- New combinations of technologies and convergences are introduced
- New products and services appear that are orders of magnitude better and cheaper
- The status quo is disrupted (and the domain gets information-enabled)

#### Value propositions are increasingly Information based

Although large traditional firms are truly different from digital entrants, many are starting to transform their businesses successfully through digital technology. Companies face common pressures from customers, employees and competitors [@Westerman2011].

Increased Value from Information: the digital business context brings new opportunities to create value from information [@Bharadwaj2013].

Many firms are able to fine-tune their actions and personalize their offerings based on information about customer preferences [@Bharadwaj2013].
Digitization allows companies to split jobs into smaller and more specialized tasks. Producers are better able to create specialized offerings for small markets: e.g.: investment advisory business has become disaggregated. Large retail banks similarly face a growing array of small, tech-enabled challengers [@Manyika2015].

#### Value propositions are increasingly Network-based: benefiting from network effects

Enabling new business or operating models, such as peer-to-peer product innovation (crowd-source features rather than investing heavily in R&D) or customer service (crowd-source customer service, so that users support each other to resolve problems), disintermediate existing customer-supplier relations [@Hirt2014].

(CIME) industries face dramatic changes in revenue streams and shifts in industry dynamics. Traditional business models face threats [@Gimpel2012].

Democratization of content as well as the subsequent sharing, remixing, redistribution, and resyndication of content have caused dramatic power shifts in market channels and dis-intermediations that disrupt traditional sources of economic profits while creating fundamentally new sources of value [@Bharadwaj2013].
#### What are Rivals jockeying for position

Rivalry among existing competitors takes the familiar form of jockeying for position-using tactics like price competition, product introduction, and advertising slugfests. Intense rivalry is related to the presence of a number of factors [@Porter1979]:

- Competitors are numerous or are roughly equal in size and power.
- Industry growth is slow.
- The product or service lacks differentiation or switching costs.
- Fixed costs are high or the product is perishable.
- Capacity is normally augmented in large increments.
- Exit barriers are high. Exit barriers, like very specialized assets or management's loyalty to a particular business, keep companies competing even though they may be earning low returns on investment.
- The rivals are diverse in strategies, origins, and "personalities", and continually run head-on into each other.

As an industry matures, its growth rate changes, resulting in declining profits and (often) a shakeout. Technological innovation can boost the level of fixed costs in the production process. While a company must live with many of these factors (because they are built into industry economics) it may have some latitude for improving matters through strategic shifts. For example, it may try to raise buyers' switching costs or increase product differentiation [@Porter1979].

#### Customer Networks

**demand-side economies of scale are not entirely new**
Positive feedback based on demand-side economies of scale, while far more important now than in the past, is not entirely novel. Any communications network has this feature: the more people using the network, the more valuable it is to each one of them. Transportation networks share similar properties: the more destinations it can reach, the more valuable a nerwork becomes [@Shapiro1999].

**network externalities are not confined to communications networks**
But network externalities are not confined to communications networks. They are also powerful in "virtual" networks, such as the network of users. A user benefits from a larger network, since this facilitates the exchange of files and tips and encourages software houses to devote more resources to developing software. Popular hardware and software systems enjoy a significant competitive advantage over less popular systems [@Shapiro1999].

As a result, growth is a strategic imperative, not just to achieve the usual production side economies of scale but to achieve the demand side economies of scale generated by network effects [@Shapiro1999].

**critical mass**
The key challenge is to obtain critical mass, after that, the going gets easier. Once you have a large enough customer base, the market will build itself [@Shapiro1999]. In the information economy, positive feedback has appeared in a new, more virulent form based on the demand side of the market, not just the supply side. Microsoft's enormous value is not based on the economies of scale in developing software. Oh, sure, there are scale economies in designing software, as for any other information product. But the cost of developing rival operating systems is tiny in comparison with Microsoft's market capitalization. Microsoft's dominance is based on demand-side economies of scale. Microsoft's customers value its operating systems because they are widely used, the de facto industry standard. Rival operating systems just don't have the critical mass to pose much of a threat [@Shapiro1999].

**demand-side economies of scale don't dissipate with growth**
Unlike the supply-side economies of scale, demand-side economies of scale don't dissipate when the market gets large enough. The beautiful if frightening implication: success and failure are driven as much by consumer expectations and luck as by the underlying value of the product. A nudge in the right direction, at the right time, can make all the difference. Marketing strategy designed to influence consumer expectations is critical in network markets [@Shapiro1999].

### Markets are increasingly network-based

A market could be considered as a special kind of network because it is two-sided. It is called a buyer-seller (or consumer-producer) bipartite network.

#### What is Threat of entry

The seriousness of the threat of entry depends on the barriers present and on the reaction from existing competitors that entrants can expect. There are six major sources of barriers to entry:

1. Economies of scale: These economies deter entry by forcing the aspirant either to come in on a large scale or to accept a cost disadvantage [@Porter1979].
1. Product differentiation: Brand identification creates a barrier by forcing entrants to spend heavily to overcome customer loyalty [@Porter1979].
1. Capital requirements: The need to invest large financial resources in order to compete creates a barrier to entry, particularly if the capital is required for unrecoverable expenditures in up-front advertising or R&D [@Porter1979].
1. Cost disadvantages independent of size: Entrenched companies may have cost advantages not available to potential rivals, no matter what their size and attainable economies of scale. Such as learning curve (and of its first cousin, the experience curve), proprietary technology, access to the best raw materials sources, assets purchased at pre-inflation prices, government subsidies, or favorable locations [@Porter1979].
1. Access to distribution channels: The newcomer on the block must, of course, secure distribution of its product or service. Sometimes this barrier is so high that, to surmount it, a new contestant must create its own distribution channels [@Porter1979].
1. Government policy: The government can limit or even foreclose entry to industries with such controls as license requirements and limits on access to raw materials. There are also indirect entry barriers through controls such as air and water pollution standards and safety regulations [@Porter1979].

The company is likely to have second thoughts if incumbents have previously lashed out at new entrants or if:

- The incumbents possess substantial resources to fight back
- The incumbents seem likely to cut prices
- Industry growth is slow, affecting its ability to absorb the new arrival

#### Networks lower barriers to entry

Innovation presents great challenges to executives in the communications, information, media, and entertainment (CIME) industries [@Gimpel2012].

This is an empowering moment for entrepreneurs: the barriers to entry have never been lower [@Manyika2015]. Prosumerization (see [this part](#prosumerization) for more information) has lowered the break-even point for producers and given birth to low-overhead startups that can compete directly with capital-intensive incumbents [@Gimpel2012]. Digital dynamics often undermine barriers to entry and long-standing sources of product differentiation [@Hirt2014].

Competitors emerge from unexpected places: Web-based service providers now tap markets without having to build distribution networks of offices. The expense of building brands on-line and the degree of consumer attention focused on a relatively small number of brands are redrawing battle lines in many markets. New competitors can often be smaller companies that will never reach scale but still do a lot of damage to incumbents [@Hirt2014]. Prepare for tougher, 360-degree competition: coming from thousands of small players in the largest marketplaces and ecosystems, such as small Chinese manufacturers on Alibaba. These small enterprises have the advantage of being "born digital" [@Manyika2015].

Once digital players have established themselves as leaders in one market, they have a striking ability to move into new areas. Amazon went from selling books to selling every retail and a self-publishing platform and a cloud-based business service. Google went from internet search to longevity and biotech research, smart home products, venture capital investing and high-speed internet fiber services [@Manyika2015].

#### What are Powerful buyers

Customers likewise can force down prices, demand higher quality or more service, and play competitors off against each other, all at the expense of industry profits [@Porter1979].

A buyer group is powerful if [@Porter1979]:

- It is concentrated or purchases in large volumes.
- The products it purchases from the industry are standard or undifferentiated.
- The products it purchases from the industry form a component of its product and represent a significant fraction of its cost. Where the product sold by the industry in question is a small fraction of buyers' costs, buyers are usually much less price sensitive.
- It earns low profits, which create great incentive to lower its purchasing costs. Highly profitable buyers, however, are generally less price sensitive.
- The industry's product is unimportant to the quality of the buyers' products or services.
- The industry's product does not save the buyer money.
- The buyers pose a credible threat of integrating backward to make the industry's product.

A company's choice of buyer groups to sell to should be viewed as a crucial strategic decision [@Porter1979].

Rarely do all the buyer groups a company sells to enjoy equal power. Segments usually exist within that industry that exercise less power (and that are therefore less price sensitive) than others. For example, the replacement market for most products is less price sensitive than the overall market [@Porter1979].

As a rule, a company can sell to Powerful Buyers and still come away with above-average profitability only if it is a low-cost producer in its industry or if its product enjoys some unusual, if not unique, features. If the company lacks a low cost position or a unique product, selling to everyone is self-defeating because the more sales it achieves, the more vulnerable it becomes. The company may have to muster the courage to turn away business and sell only to less potent customers [@Porter1979].

#### What are Powerful suppliers

Suppliers can exert bargaining power on participants in an industry by raising prices or reducing the quality of purchased goods and services [@Porter1979].

A supplier group is powerful if [@Porter1979]:

- It is dominated by a few companies and is more concentrated than the industry it sells to.
- Its product is unique or at least differentiated, or if it has built up switching costs.
- It is not obliged to contend with other products for sale to the industry.
- It poses a credible threat of integrating forward into the industry's business.
- The industry is not an important customer of the supplier group.

A company's choice of suppliers to buy from should be viewed as a crucial strategic decision [@Porter1979].

#### Increased network-intensity of market normalizes the buyers' and the suppliers' power

Information becomes widely available, disrupting traditional intermediaries: Value is shifting from physical intermediaries and asset holders to digital intermediaries and to consumers [@Manyika2015]. Internet information is now cheap, open standards have also facilitated open distribution platforms which have further resulted in more flexibility for consumers. Aggregative news services are becoming more important intermediaries [@Karimi2015]. Consider the automotive industry, Consumers now save time by comparing vehicles on-line and their on-line activity leaves a data trail that dealers can use [@Manyika2015].

**New pressure on prices and margins** Third parties have jumped into this fray, disintermediating relationships between companies and their customers. The rise of price-comparison sites and these dynamics create downward pressure on returns across consumer-facing industries, and the disruptive currents are now rippling out to B2B businesses [@Hirt2014].

Globalization reshapes the nature of supply and demand. Consumers enjoy a new world of choice [@Gimpel2012].

Power players accustomed to monopoly profits face unprecedented competition [@Gimpel2012].

The nature of productivity growth has changed in the past decade. Economic statistics do not reflect the full benefits of those innovations in the lives of consumers. Statistics are not capturing an important and innovative part of the economy because the productivity advance flows to unmeasured consumer surplus. E.g.: it is difficult for data to capture quality improvements and innovation in digital content and new capabilities in subsequent generations of advanced software [@Manyika2015].

In B2B markets, corporate purchasers are raising pressure on their suppliers to offer services that are standardized across borders, integrate with other offerings, and can be plugged into the purchasing companies' global business processes easily [@Hirt2014].
