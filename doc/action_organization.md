#### Competitive forces to analyze Organizations' environment

To understand what are the macro-economic impacts of digitalization as an organization, we propose to use the 5 competitive forces introduced by @Porter1979. Those forces are greatly depending on the industry context in which the organization is evolving and might also represents specific weak points depending on the characteristics of each organization.

The essence of strategy formulation is coping with competition. Yet it is easy to view competition too narrowly and too pessimistically. While one sometimes hears executives complaining to the contrary, intense competition in an industry is neither coincidence nor bad luck [@Porter1979].

Competition is not manifested only in the other players. Competition in an industry is rooted in its underlying economics, and competitive forces exist that go well beyond the established combatants in a particular industry. Customers, suppliers, potential entrants, and substitute products are all competitors that may be more or less prominent or active depending on the industry. Knowledge of these underlying sources of competitive pressure provides the groundwork for a strategic agenda of action [@Porter1979].

The strongest competitive force or forces determine the profitability of an industry and so are of greatest importance in strategy formulation. Even a company with a strong position in an industry unthreatened by potential entrants will earn low returns if it faces a superior or a lower-cost substitute product. Every industry has an underlying structure, or a set of fundamental economic and technical characteristics, that gives rise to these competitive forces [@Porter1979].

Industry evolution is important strategically because evolution, of course, brings with it changes in the sources of competition. In the familiar product life-cycle pattern, for example, growth rates change, product differentiation is said to decline as the business becomes more mature, and the companies tend to integrate vertically. These trends are not so important in themselves; what is critical is whether they affect the sources of competition [@Porter1979].

We suggest that the competitive forces in each industry are being intensified and taking new forms due to Digitalization and the emergence of all kind of Networks. This part aims at describing those networks and those digital trends and how they might change the various competitive forces in each industry.

### Networks introduce new Market dynamics

#### Network externalities as a positive feedback {#network-externalities}

Large networks are more attractive to users than small ones. The term that economists use to describe this effect, network externalities are crucial for competitive strategy [@Shapiro1999].

Network effects happen when the value of a good or a service increases as more consumers use them or as more supply-side partners augment the service (see next part about [network externalities](#network-externalities)). More and more, network effects become the key differentiator and driver of value creation. Firms should consider the role of network effects and multisided business models, which can be instantiated on the supply side with digitally interconnected partnerships and on the demand side with interconnections among web pages [@Bharadwaj2013].

When the value of a product to one user depends on how many other users there are, economists say that this product exhibits network externalities, or network effects. Communications technologies are a prime example: telephones, e-mail, Internet access, fax machines, and modems all exhibit network externalities. Technologies subject to strong network effects tend to exhibit long lead times followed by explosive growth. The pattern results from positive feedback: as the installed base of users grows, more and more users find adoption worthwhile. Eventually, the product achieves critical mass and takes over the market [@Shapiro1999].

Externalities arise when one market participant affects others without compensation being paid. Like feedback, externalities come in two flavors: negative and positive. The classic example of a negative externality is pollution: my sewage ruins your swimming or drinking water. Happily, network externalities are normally positive, not negative: when I join your network, the network is bigger and better, to your benefit. Positive network externalities give rise to positive feedback: when I buy a fax machine, you are more tempted to get one yourself since you can now use it to communicate with me [@Shapiro1999].

Network externalities are what lie behind Metcalfes law, named after Bob Metcalfe, the inventor of Ethernet. The square of the Metcalfe's law is more a rule of thumb than a law but it does arise in a relatively natural way. If there are n people in a network, and the value of the network to each of them is proportional to the number of other users, then the total value of the network (to all the users) is proportional to $n * (n - 1)$ which is roughly equal to $n^2$. The value of a network goes up as the square of the number of users [@Shapiro1999].

Positive feedback and network externalities are not a creation of the 1990s. To the contrary, network externalities have long been recognized as critical in the transportation and communications industries, where companies compete by expanding the reach of their networks and where one network can dramatically increase its value by interconnecting with other networks. Anyone trying to navigate the network economy has much to learn from the history of the postal service, railroads, airlines, and telephones [@Shapiro1999].

#### Networks are increasing rate of disruption & market change

Disruption has no consensual definition. However, it seems to be mostly used to depict the fact some innovations can push some incumbents out of market, barely letting them the ability to adapt. It is the fact some customer needs are met by innovations radically different from the previous state-of-the-art. We propose here that _Disruption_ is in fact the same thing as the _Substitution_ depicted by @Porter1979.

A radical innovation is the introduction of a truly new product or process. They can be introduced at any point in time cutting short the life cycle of the products or processes they substitute [@Perez2004].

Disruption, however, is not an event or immediate phenomenon but a process that may take several years or even decades [@Karimi2015]. Every radically new product, when it is first introduced, is relatively primitive. Gradually, it consolidates a position in the market. Then, there is a sort of take-off for a period of successive incremental improvements. At last, the technology reaches maturity [@Perez2004].

Neither age nor size nor reputation nor even current sales guarantee that you will be around tomorrow. The lifespan of a company is going to get even shorter in the years to come as giant corporations aren't just forced to compete with, but are annihilated -seemingly overnight- by a new breed of companies that harnesses the power of exponential technologies [@VanGeest2014].

Those enterprises that don't jump aboard soon will be left on the ash heap of history joining Iridium, Kodak, Polaroid, Philco, Blockbuster, Nokia and a host of other once-great, industry-dominant corporations unable to adapt to rapid technological change [@VanGeest2014].

Both demand-side economies of scale and supply-side economies of scale (see [this part](#information-dynamics) for more information) have been around for a long time. But the combination of the two that has arisen in many information technology industries is new. The result is a "double whammy" in which growth on the demand side both reduces cost on the supply side and makes the product more attractive to other users-accelerating the growth in demand even more. The result is especially strong positive feedback, causing entire industries to be created or destroyed far more rapidly than during the industrial age [@Shapiro1999]. New market entrants often scale up rapidly at lower cost than legacy players can. Digital capabilities increasingly will determine which companies create or lose value [@Hirt2014].

New trends emerge and disruptive entrants appear, their products and services embraced by early adopters. Advanced incumbents then begin to adjust to these changes, accelerating the rate of customer adoption until the industry's level of digitization, among companies but, perhaps more critically, among consumers as well, reaches a tipping point. Eventually, what was once radical is normal [@Hirt2014].

Disruption is the New Norm: Every industry is becoming information-based, either by being digitized or by using information to identify under-utilized assets. Collaborative Consumption leverages the internet and social networks to create a more efficient utilization of physical assets, the outsider has all the advantages. With no legacy systems to worry about, as well as the ability to enjoy low overhead and take advantage of the democratization of information and, more important, technology, the newcomer can move quickly and with a minimum of expense. The rate of change is so high everywhere these days that you now must assume that someone will disrupt you, and often from a direction you least expect. There is a consistent set of steps around disruptive innovation comprising the following [@VanGeest2014]:

- Domain (or technology) becomes information-enabled
- Costs drop exponentially and access is democratized
- Hobbyists come together to form an open source community
- New combinations of technologies and convergences are introduced
- New products and services appear that are orders of magnitude better and cheaper
- The status quo is disrupted (and the domain gets information-enabled)

#### Global networks are increasing pace of innovation & technological change

Today, a typical automotive design cycle is approximately 24 to 36 months, which is much faster than the 60-month life cycle from five years ago [@McGrath2013].

Nearly every executive cited competitive pressures to change. This relates closely to increases in the pace of business. Several executives indicated this was "the new normal" for their industries. None of the executives felt their innovation culture was as strong as it should be [@Westerman2011].

Kurzweil identified a hugely important and fundamental property of technology: when you shift to an information-based environment, the pace of development jumps onto an exponential growth path and price/performance doubles every year or two. Whereas the experts in many fields will project linearly in times of exponential change [@VanGeest2014].

Information accelerates everything: The new information paradigm is accelerating the metabolism of products, companies and industries. In industry after industry, the development cycle for products and services grows ever shorter. Nowhere is this staggering pace of change more apparent than with the consumer Internet. Many products are now launched early, unfinished and in perpetual beta, for the sole purpose of gathering data from users as early as possible to determine how to "finish" the product [@VanGeest2014].

The digital frontier is uncharted territory and the biggest risk of all is being disrupted while sitting on the sidelines [@Manyika2015]. Keeping up with the relentless pace of digital innovation is both a sprint and a marathon [@Manyika2015].

The pace of change isn't going to slow down anytime soon. In fact, Moore's Law all but guarantees that it will continue to speed up -and speed up exponentially- for at least several decades. And given the cross impact into other technologies, if the last fifteen years has seen enormous disruption in the business world, the next fifteen will make that disruption seem tame by comparison  [@VanGeest2014].

#### Value propositions are increasingly Information & Network based

Although large traditional firms are truly different from digital entrants, many are starting to transform their businesses successfully through digital technology. Companies face common pressures from customers, employees and competitors [@Westerman2011].

The digital business context brings new opportunities to create value from information [@Bharadwaj2013].

Many firms are able to fine-tune their actions and personalize their offerings based on information about customer preferences [@Bharadwaj2013].

The nature of productivity growth has changed in the past decade. Economic statistics do not reflect the full benefits of those innovations in the lives of consumers. Statistics are not capturing an important and innovative part of the economy because the productivity advance flows to unmeasured consumer surplus. E.g.: it is difficult for data to capture quality improvements and innovation in digital content and new capabilities in subsequent generations of advanced software [@Manyika2015].

Enabling new business or operating models, such as peer-to-peer product innovation (crowd-source features rather than investing heavily in R&D) or customer service (crowd-source customer service, so that users support each other to resolve problems), disintermediate existing customer-supplier relations [@Hirt2014].

(CIME) industries face dramatic changes in revenue streams and shifts in industry dynamics. Traditional business models face threats [@Gimpel2012].

Democratization of content as well as the subsequent sharing, remixing, redistribution, and resyndication of content have caused dramatic power shifts in market channels and dis-intermediations that disrupt traditional sources of economic profits while creating fundamentally new sources of value [@Bharadwaj2013].

#### Positive feedback create tippy markets: the winner takes all {#information-dynamics}

Digital businesses reduce transaction and labor costs, increase returns to scale from aggregated data. Scale economies in data and talent often are decisive [@Hirt2014].

There is a central difference between the old and new economies: the old industrial economy was driven by economies of scale; the new information economy is driven by the economics of networks. The key concept is positive feedback [@Shapiro1999].

Businesses that rely too heavily on a single revenue stream or on playing an intermediary role in a given market are particularly vulnerable. In some markets, there is a winner-take-all effect. At a broad level, the industries with the fastest profit margin growth tend to be those with the fastest growth in software intensity. And within these sectors, the margin spreads between the top-performing companies and the lowest performers are two to four times those in other sectors. The most digitized industries are developing a winner-take-all dynamic [@Manyika2015].

Positive feedback makes the strong get stronger and the weak get weaker, leading to extreme outcomes. Positive feedback should not be confused with growth as such. Yes, if a technology is on a roll, as is the Internet today^[In 1999, when it is written, it was mostly true, even if the dotcom bubble hadn't burst yet. It is less striking now.], positive feedback translates into rapid growth: success feeds on itself. This is a virtuous cycle. When two or more firms compete for a market where there is strong positive feedback, only one may emerge as the winner. Economists say that such a market is tippy, meaning that it can tip in favor of one player or another. Examples of tippy markets were the video recorder market in the 1980s (VHS v. Beta) and the personal computer operating systems market of the 1990s (Wintel v. Apple). In its most extreme form, positive feedback can lead to a winner-take-all market in which a single firm or technology vanquishes all others. These dynamics are driven by the strong desire of users to select the technology that ultimately will prevail-that is, to choose the network that has (or will have) the most users [@Shapiro1999].

#### Lower negative feedback: from long-lived oligopolies to temporal monopolies

**Demand-side economies of scale are a sustaining network effect creating a positive feedback.** Positive feedback is not entirely new; virtually every industry goes through a positive feedback phase early in its evolution. General Motors was more efficient than the smaller car companies in large part because of its scale. This efficiency fueled further growth by General Motors. This source of positive feedback is known as economies of scale in production: larger firms tend to have lower unit costs (at least up to a point). From today's perspective, we can refer to these traditional economies of scale as supply-side economies of scale. Despite its supply-side economies of scale, General Motors never grew to take over the entire automobile market. Because traditional economies of scale based on manufacturing have generally been exhausted at scales well below total market dominance. In other words, positive feedback based on supply-side economies of scale ran into natural limits, at which point negative feedback took over. These limits often arose out of the difficulties of managing enormous organizations [@Shapiro1999].

**Negative feedback leads to long-lived oligopolies.** The backward cousin of positive feedback is negative feedback. The industrial oligopolies exhibited negative feedback, at least in their mature phase. Attempts by the industry leader to capture share from smaller players would often trigger vigorous responses as smaller players sought to keep capacity utilization from falling. Furthermore, past a certain size, companies found growth difficult owing to the sheer complexity of managing a large enterprise. Sometimes sales fell below a critical mass, and companies went out of business or were acquired by more efficient rivals. But by and large, dramatic changes in market share were uncommon and oligopoly rather than monopoly was the norm [@Shapiro1999].

**From long-lived oligopolies to temporary monopolies.** The industrial economy was populated with oligopolies: industries in which a few large firms dominated their markets. This was a comfortable world, in which market shares rose and fell only gradually. This stability in the marketplace was mirrored by lifetime employment of managers. In contrast, the information economy is populated by temporary monopolies. Hardware and software firms vie for dominance, knowing that today's leading technology or architecture will, more likely than not, be toppled in short order by an upstart with superior technology [@Shapiro1999].

### Networks create new Markets & Disruption: more substitutes & rivalry

#### Networking everywhere: Virtual Networks and Platforms

Overall, as Information is growing and getting more accessible, there is an increase of connections of all kinds between actors and organizations around the world: all kinds of networks are being formed and growing.

In a network, the link pattern determines the extent to which economies of sharing are realized. For the economies to be fully realized, there must be enough links so that whichever buyers have the highest two valuations they can always obtain goods. When links are costly, it might not be optimal, from a social welfare point of view, to fully realize the economies of sharing. The gains from adding one more link need not exceed its cost [@Kranton2001].

**Smaller link costs stimulate the creation and growth of networks.** Our main result shows that when buyers compete in this way, their individual incentives to build links can be aligned with economic wellfare. Efficient network structures are always an equilibrium outcome. Indeed, for small link costs, efficient networks are the only equilibria [@Kranton2001].

Platformization is the emergence of Digital platforms that bring together suppliers, customers, and third parties. They are replacing traditional middlemen and can often serve to level the playing field by granting small players and new entrants access to formerly closed markets [@Gimpel2012]. Communications firms face substitution from over-the-top services [@Gimpel2012].

We are all familiar with physical networks such as telephone networks, railroad networks, and airline networks. Some high-tech networks are much like these "real" networks: networks of compatible fax machines. But many other high-tech products reside in "virtual" networks: the network of Macintosh, the network of Apple iPhone users, the network of Android Users [@Shapiro1999].

It is enlightening to view information technologies in terms of virtual networks, which share many properties with real networks such as communications and transportation networks. We think of all users of Macintosh users as belonging to the "Mac network." Apple is the sponsor of this network. Building a network involves more than just building a product: finding partners, building strategic alliances, and knowing how to get the bandwagon rolling can be every bit as important as engineering design skills [@Shapiro1999].

While physical processes have high marginal costs, low-marginal-cost economics and platform architecture has allowed the most successful high-tech firms to achieve a scale that was once impossible. The power of platform economics is reflected in the gross margins, which can run as high as 80 percent [@Manyika2015].

Network externalities are not confined to communications networks. They are also powerful in "virtual" networks, such as the network of users. A user benefits from a larger network, since this facilitates the exchange of files and tips and encourages software houses to devote more resources to developing software. Popular hardware and software systems enjoy a significant competitive advantage over less popular systems [@Shapiro1999].

#### Markets are Two-sided networks

A market could be considered as a special kind of network because it is two-sided. It is called a buyer-seller (or consumer-producer) bipartite network.

Two-sided markets, also called two-sided networks, are economic platforms having two distinct user groups that provide each other with network benefits. The organization that creates value primarily by enabling direct interactions between two (or more) distinct types of affiliated customers is called a multi-sided platform (MSP). [from the [Two-sided Market](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-sided_market) wikipedia page]

Benefits to each group exhibit demand economies of scale. Consumers, for example, prefer credit cards honored by more merchants, while merchants prefer cards carried by more consumers. Two-sided markets are particularly useful for analyzing the chicken-and-egg problem of standards battles, such as the competition between VHS and Beta. They are also useful in explaining many free pricing or "freemium" strategies where one user group gets free use of the platform in order to attract the other user group. [from the [Two-sided Market](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-sided_market) wikipedia page]

Two-sided markets represent a refinement of the concept of network effects. There are both same-side and cross-side network effects. Each network effect can be either positive or negative. An example of a positive same-side network effect is end-user PDF sharing or player-to-player contact in PlayStation 3; a negative same-side network effect appears when there is competition between suppliers in an online auction market or competition for dates on Match.com. [from the [Two-sided Market](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-sided_market) wikipedia page]

#### Platforms cross-side positive externality: pooling uncertainty

Networks can allow buyers and sellers collectively to pool uncertainty in demand, a motive we see in many of the above examples. When sellers have links to more buyers, they are insulated from the difficulties facing any one buyer. And when buyers purchase from the same set of sellers, there is a saving in overall investment costs [@Hagiu2015].

**Buyer-seller networks spread links among the agents and allow them to pool risks: demand and/or supply uncertainty. Because links are costly, there is a trade-off between building links and pooling risk. However, digitalization reduces the cost of new links, improving the incentive to build new links and pool risks.** Our answer to the first question is that networks can enable agents to pool uncertainty in demand. When sellers’ productive capacity is costly and buyers have uncertain valuations of goods, it is socially optimal for buyers to share the capacity of a limited number of sellers. The way in which buyers and sellers are linked, however, plays a critical role in realizing these economies of sharing, Because links are costly, there is a trade-off between building links and pooling risk. Using combinatoric techniques, we show that the links must be "spread out" among the agents and characterize the efficient link patterns which optimize this trade-off [@Kranton2001].

**French Industrial supply networks are an example of uncertainty pooling by spreading links.** We find evidence for our positive results in studies of industrial-supply networks. In many accounts, buyers are aware of the potential consequence for their suppliers of uncertainty in their demand. Buyers share suppliers, explicitly to ensure that suppliers have sufficiently high demand to cover investment costs. Buyers "spread out" their orders-reflecting the structure of efficient link patterns. In a study of engineering firms and subcontracting in France, we find a remarkably clear description of this phenomenon. Buyers keep their orders between 10-15 percent of a supplier's sales. This "10-15 percent rule" is explained as follows: "The minimum is set at 10 percent because anything less would imply a too insignificant a position in the subcontractor's order book to warrant the desired consideration. The maximum is set at 15 percent to avoid the possibility of uncertainty in the buyer's market having a damaging effect on the subcontractor’s financial position..." [@Kranton2001].

#### Networks winner-take-all dynamic is increasing Rivalry among competitors

Rivalry among existing competitors takes the familiar form of jockeying for position-using tactics like price competition, product introduction, and advertising slugfests. Intense rivalry is related to the presence of a number of factors [@Porter1979]:

- Competitors are numerous or are roughly equal in size and power.
- Industry growth is slow.
- The product or service lacks differentiation or switching costs.
- Fixed costs are high or the product is perishable.
- Capacity is normally augmented in large increments.
- Exit barriers are high. Exit barriers, like very specialized assets or management's loyalty to a particular business, keep companies competing even though they may be earning low returns on investment.
- The rivals are diverse in strategies, origins, and "personalities", and continually run head-on into each other.

In the information economy, positive feedback has appeared in a new, more virulent form based on the demand side of the market, not just the supply side. Microsoft's enormous value is not based on the economies of scale in developing software. Oh, sure, there are scale economies in designing software, as for any other information product. But the cost of developing rival operating systems is tiny in comparison with Microsoft's market capitalization. Microsoft's dominance is based on demand-side economies of scale. Microsoft's customers value its operating systems because they are widely used, the de facto industry standard. Rival operating systems just don't have the critical mass to pose much of a threat [@Shapiro1999].

Growth is a strategic imperative, not just to achieve the usual production side economies of scale but to achieve the demand side economies of scale generated by network effects [@Shapiro1999].

**Critical mass.** The key challenge is to obtain critical mass, after that, the going gets easier. Once you have a large enough customer base, the market will build itself [@Shapiro1999].

**Demand-side economies of scale don't dissipate with growth**
Unlike the supply-side economies of scale, demand-side economies of scale don't dissipate when the market gets large enough. The beautiful if frightening implication: success and failure are driven as much by consumer expectations and luck as by the underlying value of the product. A nudge in the right direction, at the right time, can make all the difference. Marketing strategy designed to influence consumer expectations is critical in network markets [@Shapiro1999].
#### Platforms create Substitutes by "Envelopment"

By placing a ceiling on prices it can charge, substitute products or services limit the potential of an industry, unless it can upgrade the quality of the product or differentiate it. Manifestly, the more attractive the price-performance trade-off offered by substitute products, the firmer the lid placed on the industry's profit potential. Substitutes not only limit profits in normal times; they also reduce the bonanza an industry can reap in boom times [@Porter1979].

According to @Porter1979, Substitutes that deserve the most attention strategically are those that:

- are subject to trends improving their price-performance trade-off with the industry's product
- are produced by industries earning high profits.

It is striking to see how these two statements, coined by @Porter1979, are still up-to-date. Today, price-performance trade-off are strongly influenced by all kinds of network effects. And industries earning high profits are typically platform-owning industries who might be tempted to envelop your market in their platform.

As products become more and more information-enabled, their markets are displaying more and more network-based markets characteristics: tippy markets, network effects and positive feedback. A substitute product which may not pose a threat at the beginning might become one, once its network has grown enough.

Consumers have been big winners in the digital economy, although most of this effect does not show up as GDP. Some tech firms are providing free products or services where traditional businesses once charged fees. In these cases, the consumer gains are siphoning value out of industries [@Manyika2015].

An example is given by the industry of GPS tracking devices which has not seen the disruption coming from the introduction of smartphones.  

Your platform may be "enveloped" by an adjacent platform provider that enters your market. Platforms frequently have over-lapping user bases. Leveraging these shared re-lationships can make it easy and attractive for one platform provider to swallow the network of another. The real damage comes when your new rival offers your platform's functionality as part of a multiplatform bundle [@Eisenmann2006].

Once digital players have established themselves as leaders in one market, they have a striking ability to move into new areas. Amazon went from selling books to selling every retail and a self-publishing platform and a cloud-based business service. Google went from internet search to longevity and biotech research, smart home products, venture capital investing and high-speed internet fiber services [@Manyika2015].

#### Platforms create subsidized or free products that increase Substitutes

The key decision is pricing. Providers of platforms for two-sided networks are able to draw revenue from both sides. In most cases, though, it makes sense to subsidize certain users. The crucial strategy question is, Which side should you subsidize, and for how long? [@Eisenmann2006]

**Information-based goods and two-sided network effects encourage release of free products. Free products are always a side of a two-sided network. Free products are often Information goods with low marginal economics.** First, a firm can rationally invest in a product it intends to give away into perpetuity even in the absence of competition. The reason is that increased demand in a complementary premium goods market more than covers the cost of investment in the free-goods market. In this case, market complementarity arises from an internetwork externality. This strategy also takes advantage of information's near zero marginal cost property as it allows a firm to subsidize an arbitrarily large market at a modest fixed cost [@Parker2005].

**The product which is subsidized is the one that stimulates the most the other side of the network.** Second, we identified distinct markets for content providers and end consumers and showed that either market can be a candidate for discounting or free distribution. Deciding which market to subsidize depends on the relative network externality benefits. At a high level of externality benefit, the market that contributes more to demand for its complement is the market to provide with a free good. At lower levels, firms may charge positive prices in both markets but keep one price artificially low [@Parker2005].

### Networks reshape existing Markets: new entrants, less powerful buyers & suppliers

#### Platforms & Technological Innovation increase Threat of Entry by small players

This is an empowering moment for entrepreneurs: the barriers to entry have never been lower [@Manyika2015]. Prosumerization (see [this part](#prosumerization) for more information) has lowered the break-even point for producers and given birth to low-overhead startups that can compete directly with capital-intensive incumbents [@Gimpel2012]. Digital dynamics often undermine barriers to entry and long-standing sources of product differentiation [@Hirt2014].

The seriousness of the threat of entry depends on the barriers present and on the reaction from existing competitors that entrants can expect. There are six major sources of barriers to entry, according to @Porter1979:

1. Economies of scale
1. Product differentiation
1. Capital requirements
1. Cost disadvantages independent of size
1. Access to distribution channels

Digitalization is modifying globally 2 of those sources of barriers to entry:

- Capital requirements: The need to invest large financial resources in order to compete creates a barrier to entry, particularly if the capital is required for unrecoverable expenditures in up-front advertising or R&D [@Porter1979]. Technological innovation and access to shared IT resources are lowering capital requirements which allows small players to create new Information-based products.
- Access to distribution channels: The newcomer on the block must, of course, secure distribution of its product or service. Sometimes this barrier is so high that, to surmount it, a new contestant must create its own distribution channels [@Porter1979]. On the other hand, platforms are competing to provide access to their users bases to small players.

Competitors emerge from unexpected places: Web-based service providers now tap markets without having to build distribution networks of offices. The expense of building brands on-line and the degree of consumer attention focused on a relatively small number of brands are redrawing battle lines in many markets. New competitors can often be smaller companies that will never reach scale but still do a lot of damage to incumbents [@Hirt2014]. Prepare for tougher, 360-degree competition: coming from thousands of small players in the largest marketplaces and ecosystems, such as small Chinese manufacturers on Alibaba. These small enterprises have the advantage of being "born digital" [@Manyika2015].

Digitization allows companies to split jobs into smaller and more specialized tasks. Producers are better able to create specialized offerings for small markets: e.g.: investment advisory business has become disaggregated. Large retail banks similarly face a growing array of small, tech-enabled challengers [@Manyika2015].

#### Platforms same-side negative externality: increased competition weakens powerful suppliers & buyers

**Same-side negative network externality: Platforms weaken powerful suppliers.** With cross-group network effects, a coordination problem with multiple equilibria arises among professionals when they decide whether or not to join the firm/MSP. In particular, each professional's expectation about the number of other professionals who join affects their individual decision [@Hagiu2015].

Customers can force down prices, demand higher quality or more service, and play competitors off against each other, all at the expense of industry profits [@Porter1979].

A buyer group is powerful if [@Porter1979]:

- It is concentrated or purchases in large volumes.
- The products it purchases from the industry are standard or undifferentiated.

Rarely do all the buyer groups a company sells to enjoy equal power. Segments usually exist within that industry that exercise less power (and that are therefore less price sensitive) than others. For example, the replacement market for most products is less price sensitive than the overall market [@Porter1979].

Information becomes widely available, disrupting traditional intermediaries: Value is shifting from physical intermediaries and asset holders to digital intermediaries and to consumers [@Manyika2015]. Internet information is now cheap, open standards have also facilitated open distribution platforms which have further resulted in more flexibility for consumers. [@Karimi2015]. Consider the automotive industry, Consumers now save time by comparing vehicles on-line and their on-line activity leaves a data trail that dealers can use [@Manyika2015].

Suppliers can exert bargaining power on participants in an industry by raising prices or reducing the quality of purchased goods and services [@Porter1979].

A supplier group is powerful if [@Porter1979]:

- It is dominated by a few companies and is more concentrated than the industry it sells to.
- Its product is unique or at least differentiated, or if it has built up switching costs.
- It is not obliged to contend with other products for sale to the industry.

Multiple links can enhance an agent's competitive position. With access to more sources of supply (demand), a buyer (seller) secures better terms of trade [@Kranton2001].

#### Platforms strengthen small players / weak consumers & buyers

**Asymmetric information is purposefully reduced by Platforms.** If suppliers' goods are of uncertain quality and the reseller can achieve economies of scale in verifying quality (i.e., verifying one of many identical goods), then the reseller mode is more valuable, because it can leverage reputation effects. Of course, MSPs can develop their own solutions to the asymmetric information problem, including most obviously a feedback system that helps pool users' experience. However, a feedback system is vulnerable to a free-rider problem, in that users have little incentive to share their experiences in a way that benefits other users. Moreover, feedback is based on past sales, and this tends to create lock-in and market power for large suppliers (e.g., PowerSellers on eBay), making it harder for new suppliers to enter than to sell to a reseller that can verify the quality of their products [@Hagiu2015].

**New pressure on prices and margins.** Third parties are disintermediating relationships between companies and their customers. The rise of price-comparison sites and these dynamics create downward pressure on returns across consumer-facing industries, and the disruptive currents are now rippling out to B2B businesses [@Hirt2014].

Globalization reshapes the nature of supply and demand. Consumers enjoy a new world of choice. Power players accustomed to monopoly profits face unprecedented competition [@Gimpel2012].

In B2B markets, corporate purchasers are raising pressure on their suppliers to offer services that are standardized across borders, integrate with other offerings, and can be plugged into the purchasing companies' global business processes easily [@Hirt2014].

**Buyer-seller networks increase market efficiency _naturally_, even if its actors are not cooperating. Networks seem to strengthen weak buyers.** We then address the second question: When can buyers and sellers, acting non-cooperatively, form the efficient network structure? A priori there is no reason to expect that buyers will have the "correct" incentives to build links, and sellers the correct incentives to invest in productive capacity. We identify properties of the _ex post_ competitive environment that are sufficient to align buyers incentives with social welfare. First, the allocation of goods is efficient. Second, the buyer earns the marginal surplus from exchange, and thus, the value of its links to economic welfare. [@Kranton2001].

#### Platforms can be more efficient than an integrated company

**Platform is more efficient to tackle varying needs of customers.** Scale and learning economies: A professional service firm facing clients with similar and repetitive needs is likely better off using the VI mode, which allows it to create and capture value by investing in centralized capabilities that can be leveraged across multiple client projects (e.g., McKinsey's standardized problem-solving methodologies). This concern is less relevant for a firm that faces clients with very idiosyncratic needs, which may prefer to function as a MSP [@Hagiu2015].

**Platform allows you to be tackle external human resources you may have difficulties to provide.** Two-sided moral hazard: In addition to the professionals' effort-related moral hazard, professional service firms can have a moral hazard of their own if they are unable to credibly commit to adequately train their employees. Depending on the value of internal training relative to professionals' existing human capital and on the difficulty of solving the training-related moral hazard problem, firms may find it optimal to abandon the VI mode and function as a MSP instead [@Hagiu2015].

**Platform competition motivates more its actors than the incentives you can provide.** Intrinsic motivation and adverse selection: While it may be possible for some VI firms to include performance-based bonuses in their payments to employees, independent professionals can be intrinsically more motivated to perform well and develop their human capital and reputation. Thus, the MSP mode should be better suited for contexts where individual human capital is the most important driver of clients' willingness-to-pay. Indeed, a well-known problem in professional service industries is the difficulty of preventing "star professionals" from becoming independent "free agents" and taking their clients with them. This means that vertically integrated professional service firms may sometimes face an adverse selection problem: the professionals willing to work for them are not necessarily the highest quality professionals [@Hagiu2015].
